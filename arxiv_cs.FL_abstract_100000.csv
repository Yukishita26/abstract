(Here, FO(<,C) extends the first-order logic FO(<) with the standard congruence modulo n relation, and FO(<,MOD) with the quantifiers checking whether the number of positions satisfying a given formula is divisible by a given n>1. These FO-languages are known to define regular languages that are decidable in AC0 and ACC0, respectively.) We obtain these results by first showing that known algebraic characterisations of FO-definability of L(A) can be captured by `localisable' properties of the transition monoid of A. Using our criterion, we then generalise the known proof of PSpace-hardness of FO(<)-definability, and establish the upper bounds not only for arbitrary DFAs but also for two-way NFAs."

As a superiority of quantum computing, QFAs have been shown exponentially more succinct on certain problems such as recognizing the language $ MOD_p = \{a^j \mid j \equiv 0 \mod p\} $ with bounded error, where $p$ is a prime number. In this paper we present improved circuit based implementations for QFA algorithms recognizing the $ MOD_p $ problem using the Qiskit framework. We focus on the case $p=11$ and provide a 3 qubit implementation for the $MOD_{11}$ problem reducing the total number of required gates using alternative approaches. We run the circuits on real IBM quantum devices but due to the limitation of the real quantum devices in the NISQ era, the results are heavily affected by the noise. This limitation reveals once again the need for algorithms using less amount of resources. Consequently, we consider an alternative 3 qubit implementation which works better in practice and obtain promising results even for the problem $ MOD_{31} $."

SMT solvers, which serve as a foundation for these tools, have thus increased support for bitvector reasoning through bit-blasting and linear arithmetic approximations. In this paper we show that similar linear arithmetic approximation of bitvector operations can be done at the source level through transformations. Specifically, we introduce new paths that over-approximate bitvector operations with linear conditions/constraints, increasing branching but allowing us to better exploit the well-developed integer reasoning and interpolation of verification tools. We show that, for reachability of bitvector programs, increased branching incurs negligible overhead yet, when combined with integer interpolation optimizations, enables more programs to be verified. We further show this exploitation of integer interpolation in the common case also enables competitive termination verification of bitvector programs and leads to the first effective technique for LTL verification of bitvector programs. Finally, we provide an in-depth case study of decompiled (""lifted"") binary programs, which emulate X86 execution through frequent use of bitvector operations. We present a new tool DarkSea, the first tool capable of verifying reachability, termination, and LTL of such lifted binaries."

The relative importance of objectives is often specified by human decision-makers. However, there is inherent uncertainty in human preferences (e.g., due to different preference elicitation methods). In this paper, we formalize the notion of uncertain human preferences and present a novel approach that accounts for uncertain human preferences in the multi-objective controller synthesis for Markov decision processes (MDPs). Our approach is based on mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and synthesizes a sound, optimally permissive multi-strategy with respect to a multi-objective property and an uncertain set of human preferences. Experimental results on a range of large case studies show that our MILP-based approach is feasible and scalable to synthesize sound, optimally permissive multi-strategies with varying MDP model sizes and uncertainty levels of human preferences. Evaluation via an online user study also demonstrates the quality and benefits of synthesized (multi-)strategies."

This paper extends the Metric Interval Temporal Logic with a distribution eventuality operator to express time-sensitive missions for a system interacting with a dynamic, probabilistic environment. This formalism enables us to describe the probabilistic occurrences of random external events as part of the task specification and event-triggered temporal constraints for the intended system's behavior. The main contributions of this paper are two folds: First, we propose a procedure to translate a specification into a stochastic timed automaton. Second, we develop an approximate-optimal probabilistic planning problem for synthesizing the control policy that maximizes the probability for the planning agent to achieve the task, provided that the external events satisfy the specification. The planning algorithm employs a truncation in the clocks for the timed automaton to reduce the planning in a countably infinite state space to a finite state space with a bounded error guarantee. We illustrate the method with a robot motion planning example."

In this paper we submit this approach to a critical analysis, in the simplest elementary particular case of a one-dimensional lattice, which can be divided in two parts. In the first part we prove that the FP global rule does not describe the dynamics of standard sandpiles, but rather furnishes a description of the quite different situation of height difference between consecutive piles. This is a semantic uncorrect difference of interpretation. In the second part we investigate the consequences of the uncorrect FP assumption proving that their global rule describes a bidirectional spurious dynamics of icepiles (rather than sandpiles), in the sense that this latter is the consequence of application of three local rules: bidirectional vertical rule, bidirectional horizontal rule (typical of icepiles), and a granule jump from the bottom to the top (spurious rule of the dynamics)."

The task is challenging as it requires abstract problem understanding and symbolic reasoning with axiomatic knowledge. However, current datasets are either small in scale or not publicly available. Thus, we construct a new large-scale benchmark, Geometry3K, consisting of 3,002 geometry problems with dense annotation in formal language. We further propose a novel geometry solving approach with formal language and symbolic reasoning, called Interpretable Geometry Problem Solver (Inter-GPS). Inter-GPS first parses the problem text and diagram into formal language automatically via rule-based text parsing and neural object detecting, respectively. Unlike implicit learning in existing methods, Inter-GPS incorporates theorem knowledge as conditional rules and performs symbolic reasoning step by step. A theorem predictor is also designed to infer the theorem application sequence fed to the symbolic solver for the more efficient and reasonable searching path. Extensive experiments on the Geometry3K and GEOS datasets demonstrate Inter-GPS achieves significant improvements over existing methods."

ITL allows for the reasoning about systems in terms of behaviours which are represented as non-empty sequences of states. It allows for the specification of systems at different levels of abstraction. At a high level this specification is in terms of properties, for instance safety and liveness properties. At concrete level one can specify a system in terms of programming constructs. One can execute these concrete specification, i.e., test and simulate the behaviour of the system. In this paper we will formalise this notion of executability of ITL specifications. ITL also has a reflection operator which allows for the reasoning about reversed behaviours.

These are linear inequalities that form inductive invariants for Petri nets, capable of disproving reachability or coverability. IHS generalize classic notions of invariants like traps or siphons. Their synthesis is desirable for disproving reachability or coverability where traditional invariants may fail.   We formulate a CEGAR-loop for the synthesis of IHS. The first step is to establish a structure theory of IHS. We analyze the space of IHS with methods from discrete mathematics and derive a linear constraint system closely over-approximating the space. To discard false positives, we provide an algorithm that decides whether a given half space is indeed inductive, a problem that we prove to be coNP-complete. We implemented the CEGAR-loop in the tool INEQUALIZER and our experiments show that it is competitive against state-of-the-art techniques."

Applying the bounded synthesis, we reduce the supervisor synthesis into a problem of satisfying a safety condition. First, we consider a synthesis problem of a directed controller using the safety condition. We assign a negative reward to the unsafe states and introduce an expected return with a state-dependent discount factor. We compute a winning region and a directed controller with the maximum satisfaction probability using a dynamic programming method, where the expected return is used as a value function. Next, we construct a permissive supervisor via the optimal value function. We show that the supervisor accomplishes the maximum satisfaction probability and maximizes the reachable set within the winning region. Finally, for an unknown SDES, we propose a two-stage model-free reinforcement learning method for efficient learning of the winning region and the directed controllers with the maximum satisfaction probability. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by simulation."

It turns out that pregroups themselves can be characterized as pointed spiders in the category of preordered relations, where they naturally arise from grammars. The other way around preordered spider algebras in general can be characterized as unions of pregroups. This extends the characterization of relational spider algebras as disjoint unions of groups. The compositional framework that emerged with the results suggests new ways to understand and apply the basis structures in machine learning and data analysis."

We prove that GFG-PDA recognise more languages than deterministic PDA (DPDA) but not all context-free languages (CFL). This class is orthogonal to unambiguous CFL. We further show that GFG-PDA can be exponentially more succinct than DPDA, while PDA can be double-exponentially more succinct than GFG-PDA. We also study GFGness in visibly pushdown automata (VPA), which enjoy better closure properties than PDA, and for which we show GFGness to be EXPTIME-complete. GFG-VPA can be exponentially more succinct than deterministic VPA, while VPA can be exponentially more succinct than GFG-VPA. Both of these lower bounds are tight.   Finally, we study the complexity of resolving nondeterminism in GFG-PDA. Every GFG-PDA has a positional resolver, a function that resolves nondeterminism and that is only dependant on the current configuration. Pushdown transducers are sufficient to implement the resolvers of GFG-VPA, but not those of GFG-PDA. GFG-PDA with finite-state resolvers are determinisable."

Several attempts has been made to find a generative device that is sufficiently powerful to represent languages of semantic graphs, while at the same allowing efficient parsing. We add to this line of work by introducing graph extension grammar, which consists of an algebra over graphs together with a regular tree grammar that generates expressions over the operations of the algebra. Due to the design of the operations, these grammars can generate graphs with non-structural reentrancies; a type of node-sharing that is excessively common in formalisms such as abstract meaning representation, but for which existing devices offer little support. We provide a parsing algorithm for graph extension grammars, which is proved to be correct and run in polynomial time."

The algorithm amounts to a procedure that transforms a recursion scheme of order $n$ to a recursion scheme of order $n-1$, preserving acceptance, and increasing the size only exponentially. After repeating the procedure $n$ times, we obtain a recursion scheme of order $0$, for which the problem boils down to solving a finite parity game. Since the size grows exponentially at each step, the overall complexity is $n$-EXPTIME, which is known to be optimal. More precisely, the transformation is linear in the size of the recursion scheme, assuming that the arity of employed nonterminals and the size of the automaton are bounded by a constant; this results in an FPT algorithm for the model-checking problem.   Our transformation is a generalization of a previous transformation of the author (2020), working for reachability automata in place of parity automata. The step-by-step approach can be opposed to previous algorithms solving the considered problem ""in one step"", being compulsorily more complicated."

Often, two transducers that model similar systems differ locally from one another, by behaving similarly, up to permutations of the input and output letters within ""rounds"". In this work, we introduce and study notions of simulation by rounds and equivalence by rounds of transducers. In our setting, words are partitioned to consecutive subwords of a fixed length $k$, called rounds. Then, a transducer $\mathcal{T}_1$ is $k$-round simulated by transducer $\mathcal{T}_2$ if, intuitively, for every input word $x$, we can permute the letters within each round in $x$, such that the output of $\mathcal{T}_2$ on the permuted word is itself a permutation of the output of $\mathcal{T}_1$ on $x$. Finally, two transducers are $k$-round equivalent if they simulate each other.   We solve two main decision problems, namely whether $\mathcal{T}_2$ $k$-round simulates $\mathcal{T}_1$ (1) when $k$ is given as input, and (2) for an existentially quantified $k$.   We demonstrate the usefulness of the definitions by applying them to process symmetry: a setting in which a permutation in the identities of processes in a multi-process system naturally gives rise to two transducers, whose $k$-round equivalence corresponds to stability against such permutations."

Model checking has been proposed for validation of CPSs, but the models of the environment are either too specific to capture the variability of the environment, or too abstract to provide counter-examples interpretable by experts in the application domain. Domain-specific solutions to this problem require expertise in both formal methods and the application domain, which prevents effective application of model checking in CPSs validation. A domain-independent framework based on timed-automata is proposed for abstraction and refinement of environment models during model checking. The framework maintains an abstraction tree of environment models, which provides interpretable counter-examples while ensuring coverage of environment behaviors. With the framework, experts in the application domain can effectively use model checking without expertise in formal methods."

We approach this question by using formal languages for specifying families of graphs.

This condition holds trivially if $L$ is regular.   In order to show our results, we split $L$ into a finite union of subsets $L_\alpha$.

A striking example is the reachability problem for three-dimensional VASSes (3-VASSes): it is only known to be PSpace-hard and not known to be elementary. One possible approach which turned out to be successful for many VASS subclasses is to prove that to check reachability it suffices to inspect only runs of some bounded length. This approach however has its limitations, it is usually hard to design an algorithm substantially faster than the possible size of finite reachability sets in that VASS subclass. In 2010 Leroux has proven that non-reachability between two configurations implies separability of the source from target by some semilinear set, which is an inductive invariant. There can be a reasonable hope that it suffices to look for separators of bounded size, which would deliver an efficient algorithm for VASS reachability. In the paper we show that in VASSes fulfilling certain conditions existence of only long runs between some configurations implies existence of only big separators between some other configurations (and in a slightly modified VASS). Additionally we prove that a few known examples of hard VASSes fulfil the mentioned conditions. Therefore improving the complexity of the reachability problem (for any subclass) using the separators approach can meet serious obstacles."

To alleviate such limitations, we devise two algorithms for inferring concise LTL formulas even in the presence of noise. Our first algorithm infers minimal LTL formulas by reducing the inference problem to a problem in maximum satisfiability and then using off-the-shelf MaxSAT solvers to find a solution. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to incorporate the usage of MaxSAT solvers for inferring formulas in LTL.

In the work of Rizk et al., the authors propose a definition of robustness in linear temporal logic (LTL) through which, on the basis of multiple numerical timed traces obtained by considering different parameter configurations, they verify the robustness of a reaction network. In this paper, we focus on a notion of initial concentration robustness ($\alpha$-robustness), which is related to the influence of the perturbation of the initial concentration of one species (i.e., the input) on the concentration of another species (i.e., the output) at the steady state. We characterize this notion of robustness in the framework proposed by Rizk et al., and we show that, for monotonic reaction networks, this allows us to drastically reduce the number of traces necessary to verify robustness of the CRN."
2021-04-27 19:06:15+00:00,2021-04-27 19:06:15+00:00,"In this work, we consider translating tock-CSP into Timed Automata for UPPAAL to facilitate using UPPAAL in reasoning about temporal specifications of tock-CSP models. The process algebra tock-CSP provides textual notations for modelling discrete-time behaviours, with the support of tools for automatic verification. Similarly, automatic verification of Timed Automata (TA) with a graphical notation is supported by the UPPAAL real-time verification toolbox \uppaal. The two modelling approaches, TA and tock-CSP, differ in both modelling and verification approaches, temporal logic and refinement, respectively, as well as their provided facilities for automatic verification. For instance, liveness requirements are difficult to specify with the constructs of tock-CSP, but they are easy to specify and verify in UPPAAL. To take advantage of temporal logic, we translate tock-CSP into TA for \uppaal; we have developed a translation technique and its supporting tool. We provide rules for translating tock-CSP into a network of small TAs for capturing the compositional structure of tock-CSP that is not available in TA. For validation, we start with an experimental approach based on finite approximations to trace sets. Then, we explore mathematical proof to establish the correctness of the rules for covering infinite traces."
2021-04-27 18:35:24+00:00,2021-04-27 18:35:24+00:00,"The classical powerset construction is a standard method converting a nondeterministic automaton into a deterministic one recognising the same language. Recently, the powerset construction has been lifted to a more general framework that converts an automaton with side-effects, given by a monad, into a deterministic automaton accepting the same language. The resulting automaton has additional algebraic properties, both in the state space and transition structure, inherited from the monad. In this paper, we study the reverse construction and present a framework in which a deterministic automaton with additional algebraic structure over a given monad can be converted into an equivalent succinct automaton with side-effects. Apart from recovering examples from the literature, such as the canonical residual finite-state automaton and the \'atomaton, we discover a new canonical automaton for a regular language by relating the free vector space monad over the two element field to the neighbourhood monad. Finally, we show that every regular language satisfying a suitable property parametric in two monads admits a size-minimal succinct acceptor."
2021-04-27 16:45:11+00:00,2021-04-27 16:45:11+00:00,"We present a new synthesis algorithm to solve program synthesis over noisy datasets, i.e., data that may contain incorrect/corrupted input-output examples. Our algorithm uses an abstraction refinement based optimization process to synthesize programs which optimize the tradeoff between the loss over the noisy dataset and the complexity of the synthesized program. The algorithm uses abstractions to divide the search space of programs into subspaces by computing an abstract value that represents outputs for all programs in a subspace. The abstract value allows our algorithm to compute, for each subspace, a sound approximate lower bound of the loss over all programs in the subspace. It iteratively refines these abstractions to further subdivide the space into smaller subspaces, prune subspaces that do not contain an optimal program, and eventually synthesize an optimal program.   We implemented this algorithm in a tool called Rose. We compare Rose to a current state-of-the-art noisy program synthesis system using the SyGuS 2018 benchmark suite. Our evaluation demonstrates that Rose significantly outperforms this previous system: on two noisy benchmark program synthesis problems sets drawn from the SyGus 2018 benchmark suite, Rose delivers speedups of up to 1587 and 81.7, with median speedups of 20.5 and 81.7. Rose also terminates on 20 (out of 54) and 4 (out of 11) more benchmark problems than the previous system. Both Rose and the previous system synthesize programs that are optimal over the provided noisy data sets. For the majority of the problems in the benchmark sets ($272$ out of $286$), the synthesized programs also produce correct outputs for all inputs in the original (unseen) noise-free data set. These results highlight the benefits that Rose can deliver for effective noisy program synthesis."

Nevertheless, while many programming languages consider asynchronous fifo channel communication, the notion of subtyping used in session type implementations is the one defined by Gay and Hole for synchronous communication. This might be because there are several notions of asynchronous session subtyping, these notions are usually undecidable, and only recently sound (but not complete) algorithmic characterizations for these subtypings have been proposed. But the fact that the definition of asynchronous session subtyping and the theory behind related algorithms are not easily accessible to non-experts may also prevent further integration. The aim of this paper, and of the tool presented therein, is to make the growing body of knowledge about asynchronous session subtyping more accessible, thus promoting its integration in practical applications of session types."

We also lift the latter result to grammars: commutative images of one-register context-free languages are rational, and in consequence commutatively equivalent to register automata. We conjecture analogous results for automata and grammars with arbitrarily many registers."

Here, we consider graybox active learning of subsequential string transducers, where a regular overapproximation of the domain is known by the student. We show that there exists an algorithm using string equation solvers that uses this knowledge to learn subsequential string transducers with a better guarantee on the required number of equivalence queries than classical active learning."

In this paper, we study synthesis of deceptive winning strategies in two-player turn-based zero-sum reachability games on graphs with one-sided incomplete information of action sets. In particular, we consider the class of games in which Player 1 (P1) starts with a non-empty set of private actions, which she may 'reveal' to Player 2 (P2) during the course of the game. P2 is equipped with an inference mechanism using which he updates his perception of P1's action set whenever a new action is revealed. Under this information structure, the objective of P1 is to reach a set of goal states in the game graph while that of P2 is to prevent it. We address the question: how can P1 leverage her information advantages to deceive P2 into choosing actions that in turn benefit P1? To this end, we introduce a dynamic hypergame model to capture the reachability game with evolving misperception of P2. Analyzing the game qualitatively, we design algorithms to synthesize deceptive sure and almost-sure winning regions, and establish two key results: (1) under sure-winning condition, deceptive winning strategy is equivalent to the non-deceptive winning strategy - i.e. use of deception has no advantages, (2) under almost-sure winning condition, the deceptive winning strategy could be more powerful than the non-deceptive strategy. We illustrate our algorithms using a capture-the-flag game, and demonstrate the use of proposed approach to a larger class of games with temporal logic objectives."

From this perspective, we study a Brzozowski's style minimization algorithm for tree automata. First, we prove correct this method relying on the following fact: when the automata-based and the language-based congruences coincide, determinizing the automaton yields the minimal one. Such automata-based congruences, in the case of word automata, are defined using pre and post operators. Now we extend these operators to tree automata, a task that is particularly challenging due to the reduced expressive power of deterministic top-down (or equivalently co-deterministic bottom-up) automata. We leverage further our framework to offer two extensions of the original result by Brzozowski for word automata."

We observe that rational-valued verifiers can be simulated by integer-valued verifiers, and, their protocols can be simulated in nondeterministic polynomial time.

With the development of quantum computing and quantum control, a natural problem is to simulate DES by means of quantum computing models and to establish {\it quantum DES} (QDES). The motivation is twofold: on the one hand, QDES have potential applications when DES are simulated and processed by quantum computers, where quantum systems are employed to simulate the evolution of states driven by discrete events, and on the other hand, QDES may have essential advantages over DES concerning state complexity for imitating some practical problems. The goal of this paper is to establish a basic framework of QDES by using {\it quantum finite automata} (QFA) as the modelling formalisms, and the supervisory control theorems of QDES are established and proved. Then we present a polynomial-time algorithm to decide whether or not the controllability condition holds. In particular, we construct a number of new examples of QFA to illustrate the supervisory control of QDES and to verify the essential advantages of QDES over DES in state complexity."

In this paper, we focus on synthesis of a control strategy and parameter valuation for a PTA such that each run of the resulting TA reaches a target location within the given amount of time while avoiding unsafe locations. We propose an algorithm based on depth first analysis combined with an iterative feasibility check. The algorithm iteratively constructs a symbolic representation of the possible solutions, and employs a feasibility check to terminate the exploration along infeasible directions. Once the construction is completed, a mixed integer linear program is solved for each candidate strategy to generate a parameter valuation and a control strategy pair. We present a robotic planning example to motivate the problem and to illustrate the results."

Each atomic proposition is assumed to represent a state space region described by a multivariate polynomial inequality. The proposed approach is based on sampling the trajectories in a manner that captures all region transitions, to yield a discrete word called a trace, which is amenable to established formal methods for path checking. The continuous-time trajectory is shown to satisfy the specification if and only if the trace does. General topological conditions on the sample points are derived that ensure a trace is recorded for arbitrary continuous paths, given arbitrary region descriptions. Using techniques from computer algebra, a trace generation algorithm is developed to satisfy these conditions when the path and region boundaries are defined by polynomials. The proposed PolyTrace algorithm has polynomial complexity in the number of atomic propositions, and is guaranteed to produce a trace of any polynomial path. Its performance is demonstrated via numerical simulations."

This leads to a need for checking city states against city requirements at runtime. In this paper, we develop a novel spatial-temporal specification-based monitoring system for smart cities. We first describe a study of over 1,000 smart city requirements, some of which cannot be specified using existing logic such as Signal Temporal Logic (STL) and its variants. To tackle this limitation, we develop SaSTL -- a novel Spatial Aggregation Signal Temporal Logic -- for the efficient runtime monitoring of safety and performance requirements in smart cities. We develop two new logical operators in SaSTL to augment STL for expressing spatial aggregation and spatial counting characteristics that are commonly found in real city requirements. We define Boolean and \newcontent{quantitative semantics}~for SaSTL in support of the analysis of city performance across different periods and locations. We also develop efficient monitoring algorithms that can check a SaSTL requirement in parallel over multiple data streams (e.g., generated by multiple sensors distributed spatially in a city). Additionally, we build a SaSTL-based monitoring tool to support decision making of different stakeholders to specify and runtime monitor their requirements in smart cities. We evaluate our SaSTL monitor by applying it to three case studies with large-scale real city sensing data (e.g., up to 10,000 sensors in one study). The results show that SaSTL has a much higher coverage expressiveness than other spatial-temporal logic, and with a significant reduction of computation time for monitoring requirements. We also demonstrate that the SaSTL monitor improves the safety and performance of smart cities via simulated experiments."

We compare the expressive power of these representations and prove the negative definability of both first-order representations using the pumping lemmas. We present an approach to automatically infer program invariants of ADT-manipulating programs by a reduction to a finite model finder. The implementation called RInGen has been evaluated against state-of-the-art invariant synthesizers and has been experimentally shown to be competitive. In particular, program invariants represented by automata are capable of expressing more complex properties of computation and their automatic construction is often less expensive."

An analogous problem can be stated in the setting of register automata. We draw the complete decidability/complexity landscape of the deterministic membership problem, in the setting of both register and timed automata. For register automata, we prove that the deterministic membership problem is decidable when the input automaton is a nondeterministic one-register automaton (possibly with epsilon transitions) and the number of registers of the output deterministic register automaton is fixed. This is optimal: We show that in all the other cases the problem is undecidable, i.e., when either 1) the input nondeterministic automaton has two registers or more (even without epsilon transitions), or 2) it uses guessing, or 3) the number of registers of the output deterministic automaton is not fixed. The landscape for timed automata follows a similar pattern. We show that the problem is decidable when the input automaton is a one-clock nondeterministic timed automaton without epsilon transitions and the number of clocks of the output deterministic timed automaton is fixed. Again, this is optimal: We show that the problem in all the other cases is undecidable, i.e., when either 1) the input nondeterministic timed automaton has two clocks or more, or 2) it uses epsilon transitions, or 3) the number of clocks of the output deterministic automaton is not fixed."

Objective: Presenting two new Petri net slicing algorithms to isolate those places and transitions of a Petri net (the slice) that may contribute tokens to one or more places given (the slicing criterion).   Method: The two algorithms proposed are formalized. The completeness of the first algorithm and the minimality of the second algorithm are formally proven. Both algorithms together with other three state-of-the-art algorithms have been implemented and integrated into a single tool so that we have been able to carry out a fair empirical evaluation.   Results: Besides the two new Petri net slicing algorithms, a public, free, and open-source implementation of five algorithms is reported. The results of an empirical evaluation of the new algorithms and the slices that they produce are also presented.   Conclusions: The first algorithm collects all places and transitions that may influence (in any computation) the slicing criterion, while the second algorithm collects a minimum set of places and transitions that may influence (in some computation) the slicing criterion. Therefore, the net computed by the first algorithm can reproduce any computation that contributes tokens to any place of interest. In contrast, the second algorithm loses this possibility but it often produces a much more reduced subnet (which still can reproduce some computations that contribute tokens to some places of interest). The first algorithm is proven complete, and the second one is proven minimal."

Issues found include: invalid assignment, (temporary) unavailable data in memory cells, excessive memory allocation, (accidental) heap alteration in unexpected regions and others. Excessive memory allocation is nowadays successfully resolved by memory analysers like Valgrind. Essentially, papers in those areas did not bring any big breakthrough. Possible reasons may also include the decrease of tension due to more available memory and parallel threads. However, starting with Apt, problems related to variable modes have not yet been resolved -- neither entirely nor in an acceptable way.

Each realization of a stochastic process either satisfies or violates an STL formula. In fact, we can assign a robustness value to each realization that indicates how robustly this realization satisfies an STL formula. We then define the risk of a stochastic process not satisfying an STL formula robustly, referred to as the ""STL robustness risk"". In our definition, we permit general classes of risk measures such as, but not limited to, the value-at-risk. While in general hard to compute, we propose an approximation of the STL robustness risk. This approximation has the desirable property of being an upper bound of the STL robustness risk when the chosen risk measure is monotone, a property satisfied by most risk measures. Motivated by the interest in data-driven approaches, we present a sampling-based method for calculating an upper bound of the approximate STL robustness risk for the value-at-risk that holds with high probability. While we consider the case of the value-at-risk, we highlight that such sampling-based methods are viable for other risk measures."

We will argue that it is possible, for at least a subset of L-systems and the languages they generate, to map string admissibility conditions (the 'Three Laws') to local tree admissibility conditions (cf. Rogers, 1997). This is equivalent to defining a model for those languages.

We model such an adversarial interaction using a formal model -- a reachability game with partially controllable observation functions. The main contribution of this paper is to assess the cost of P1's unawareness: Suppose P1 misinterprets the sensor failures as probabilistic node failures due to unreliable network communication, and P2 is aware of P1's misinterpretation in addition to her partial observability. Then, from which states can P2 carry out sensor attacks to ensure, with probability one, that P1 will not be able to complete her reachability task even though, due to misinterpretation, P1 believes that she can almost-surely achieve her task. We develop an algorithm to solve the almost-sure winning sensor-attack strategy given P1's observation-based strategy. Our attack analysis could be used for attack detection in wireless communication networks and the design of provably secured attack-aware sensor allocation in decision-theoretic models for cyber-physical systems."

In this paper, we give a new characterization of such sequences in terms of the underlying numeration tree $T(L)$ whose nodes are words of $L$. We may decorate these nodes by the sequence of interest following a breadth-first enumeration. For a prefix-closed regular language $L$, we prove that a sequence is $S$-regular if and only if the tree $T(L)$ decorated by the sequence is linear, i.e., the decoration of a node depends linearly on the decorations of a fixed number of ancestors.   Next, we introduce and study regular sequences in a rational base numeration system, whose numeration language is known to be highly non-regular. We motivate and comment our definition that a sequence is $\frac{p}{q}$-regular if the underlying numeration tree decorated by the sequence is linear. We give the first few properties of such sequences, we provide a few examples of them, and we propose a method for guessing $\frac{p}{q}$-regularity. Then we discuss the relationship between $\frac{p}{q}$-automatic sequences and $\frac{p}{q}$-regular sequences. We finally present a graph directed linear representation of a $\frac{p}{q}$-regular sequence. Our study permits us to highlight the places where the regularity of the numeration language plays a predominant role."

C. Costa 20 years ago from a rather different angle, since Costa's work relies on the use of advanced developments in profinite topology, whereas what is presented here essentially uses an algebraic, language-based approach."

Existing methods for solving this problem can be described as search procedures for an invariant whose quantification prefix fits a particular template. We propose an alternative constructive approach that does not prescribe, a priori, a specific quantifier prefix. Instead, the required prefix is automatically inferred without any search by carefully analyzing the structural symmetries of the protocol. The key insight underlying this approach is that symmetry and quantification are closely related concepts that express protocol invariance under different re-arrangements of its components. We propose symmetric incremental induction, an extension of the finite-domain IC3/PDR algorithm, that automatically derives the required quantified inductive invariant by exploiting the connection between symmetry and quantification. While various attempts have been made to exploit symmetry in verification applications, to our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a direct link between symmetry and quantification in the context of clause learning during incremental induction. We also describe a procedure to automatically find a minimal finite size, the cutoff, that yields a quantified invariant proving safety for any size.   Our approach is implemented in IC3PO, a new verifier for distributed protocols that significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art, scales orders of magnitude faster, and robustly derives compact inductive invariants fully automatically."

First, the generalization of transition functions to conditional distributions studied by Carlyle and Starke. This in turn has led to a generalization of time-discrete Markov chains in which the chains are governed by more than one transition probability matrix. Second, the generalization of regular sets by introducing stochastic automata as described by Rabin. Stochastic automata are well-investigated. This report provides a short introduction to stochastic automata based on the valuable book of Claus.

In practical problems, these equations are discretized on a computational domain, and numerical solutions are computed. A numerical scheme is called convergent, if in the limit of infinitesimal discretization, the bounds on the discretization error is also infinitesimally small. The approximate solution converges to the ""true solution"" in this limit. The Lax equivalence theorem enables a proof of convergence given consistency and stability of the method. In this work, we formally prove the Lax equivalence theorem using the Coq Proof Assistant. We assume a continuous linear differential operator between complete normed spaces, and define an equivalent mapping in the discretized space. Given that the numerical method is consistent (i.e., the discretization error tends to zero as the discretization step tends to zero), and the method is stable (i.e., the error is uniformly bounded), we formally prove that the approximate solution converges to the true solution. We then demonstrate convergence of the difference scheme on an example problem by proving both its consistency and stability, and then applying the Lax equivalence theorem. In order to prove consistency, we use the Taylor-Lagrange theorem by formally showing that the discretization error is bounded above by the nth power of the discretization step, where n is the order of the truncated Taylor polynomial."

For the average case analysis one often relies on the uniform random generation using a specific grammar for regular expressions, that can represent regular languages with more or less redundancy. Generators that are uniform on the set of expressions are not necessarily uniform on the set of regular languages. Nevertheless, it is not straightforward that asymptotic estimates obtained by considering the whole set of regular expressions are different from those obtained using a more refined set that avoids some large class of equivalent expressions. In this paper we study a set of expressions that avoid a given absorbing pattern. It is shown that, although this set is significantly smaller than the standard one, the asymptotic average estimates for the size of the Glushkov automaton for these expressions does not differ from the standard case."

Mathematically, the concept of exact learning in that classical setting can be seen as the use of a particular type of metric for learning in the limit. In this short research note we use Niyogi's extended version of a theorem by Blum and Blum (1975) on the existence of locking data sets to prove a necessary condition for learnability in the limit of any family of languages in any given metric. This recovers Gold's theorem as a special case. Moreover, when the language family is further assumed to contain all finite languages, the same condition also becomes sufficient for learnability in the limit."

To compensate the lack of knowledge on the supervisor, we assume that the adversary has recorded a (prefix-closed) finite set of observations of the runs of the closed-loop system, which can be used for assisting the synthesis. We present a heuristic algorithm for the synthesis of covert damage-reachable attackers, based on the model of the plant and the (finite) set of observations, by a transformation into solving an instance of the partial-observation supervisor synthesis problem. The heuristic algorithm developed in this paper may allow the adversary to synthesize covert attackers without having to know the model of the supervisor, which could be hard to obtain in practice. For simplicity, we shall only consider covert attackers that are able to carry out sensor replacement attacks and actuator disablement attacks. The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated on a water tank example adapted from the literature."

Our semantics sheds new light on the structure of the Event-B language, allowing us to clearly delineate three constituent sub-languages: the superstructure, infrastructure and mathematical languages. One of the principal goals of our semantics is to provide access to the generic modularisation constructs available in institutions, including specification-building operators for parameterisation and refinement. We demonstrate how these features subsume and enhance the corresponding features already present in Event-B through a detailed study of their use in a worked example.

We present a method to evaluate the initial nonrepetitive complexity of regular episturmian words extending the work of Wojcik on Sturmian words. For this, we develop a theory of generalized Ostrowski numeration systems and show how to associate with each episturmian word a unique sequence of numbers written in this numeration system.   The description of the initial nonrepetitive complexity allows us to obtain novel results on the Diophantine exponents of regular episturmian words. We prove that the Diophantine exponent of a regular episturmian word is finite if and only if its directive word has bounded partial quotients. Moreover, we prove that the Diophantine exponent of a regular episturmian word is strictly greater than $2$ if the sequence of partial quotients is eventually at least $3$.   Given an infinite word $x$ over an integer alphabet, we may consider a real number $\xi_x$ having $x$ as a fractional part. The Diophantine exponent of $x$ is a lower bound for the irrationality exponent of $\xi_x$. Our results thus yield nontrivial lower bounds for the irrationality exponents of real numbers whose fractional parts are regular episturmian words. As a consequence, we identify a new uncountable class of transcendental numbers whose irrationality exponents are strictly greater than $2$. This class contains an uncountable subclass of Liouville numbers."

They incorporate design principles that are typically very hard to verify formally. In particular, the standard exhaustive formal verification techniques are unlikely to scale well for the complex designs that are developed in industry. Furthermore, the Stateflow language lacks a formal semantics, which additionally hinders the formal analysis.   To address these challenges, we lay here the foundations of a scalable technique for provably correct formal analysis of Stateflow models, with respect to invariant properties, based on bounded model checking (BMC) over symbolic executions. The crux of our technique is: i) a representation of the state space of Stateflow models as a symbolic transition system (STS) over the symbolic configurations of the model, as the basis for BMC, and ii) application of incremental BMC, to generate verification results after each unrolling of the next-state relation of the transition system. To this end, we develop a symbolic structural operational semantics (SSOS) for Stateflow, starting from an existing structural operational semantics (SOS), and show the preservation of invariant properties between the two. Next, we define bounded invariant checking for STS over symbolic configurations as a satisfiability problem. We develop an automated procedure for generating the initial and next-state predicates of the STS, and propose an encoding scheme of the bounded invariant checking problem as a set of constraints, ready for automated analysis with standard, off-the-shelf satisfiability solvers. Finally, we present preliminary results from an experimental comparison of our technique against the Simulink Design Verifier, the proprietary built-in tool of the Simulink environment."

It is known that any rational relation of infinite words, i.e. a relation given as a transducer, admits a rational uniformizer. Although rational, those uniformizers are not necessarily well-behaved, in the sense that the $i$th letter of the output word may depend on the whole infinite input word. In other words, those uniformizers might not be continuous (for the Cantor topology). This paper addresses the question of whether rational relations of infinite words can be uniformized by continuous functions. On the negative side, continuous uniformizers might not exist in general and we prove that deciding their existence is algorithmically impossible. On the positive side, we exhibit a large class of rational relations of infinite words, called weakly deterministic rational relations, for which deciding whether a relation in this class admits a continuous uniformizer is an ExpTime-c problem. This class includes the known classes of deterministic rational relations and automatic relations of infinite words.   As an application of the previous result, and by exploiting a connection between computability and continuity for rational functions of infinite words, we show a result on the synthesis of computable functions from specifications given as weakly deterministic rational relations. In particular, we show that deciding the existence of a computable uniformizer is ExpTime-c and if there is one, it is possible to effectively synthesize a deterministic two-way transducer computing it. This generalizes the classical setting of Church synthesis to asynchronous implementations which can arbitrarily delay the production of their output signals."

In many contexts, e.g., patrolling, testing, behavior prediction, and planning on idealized models, predictable or biased controllers are undesirable. To address these concerns, we introduce the \emph{Entropic Reactive Control Improvisation} (ERCI) framework and algorithm that supports synthesizing control policies for stochastic games that are declaratively specified by (i) a \emph{hard constraint} specifying what must occur (ii) a \emph{soft constraint} specifying what typically occurs, and (iii) a \emph{randomization constraint} specifying the unpredictability and variety of the controller, as quantified using causal entropy.

We establish a landscape of decidability results for these three objectives and weighted specifications with partial domain over finite words given by deterministic weighted automata equipped with sum, discounted-sum and average measures.

This motivates the introduction of a constructive variant of one-tape machines, called weight-reducing machine, and the investigation of its properties. We focus on the deterministic case. In particular, we show that, paying a polynomial size increase only, each weight-reducing machine can be turned into a halting one that works in linear time. Furthermore each weight-reducing machine can be converted into equivalent nondeterministic and deterministic finite automata by paying exponential and doubly-exponential increase in size, respectively.

However the problem remains open in the general case, the best-known upper bound being exponential. We present a new approach in which unrestricted nondeterministic finite automata are simulated by deterministic models extending two-way deterministic finite automata, paying a polynomial increase of size only. Indeed, we study the costs of the conversions of nondeterministic finite automata into some variants of one-tape deterministic Turing machines working in linear time, namely Hennie machines, weight-reducing Turing machines, and weight-reducing Hennie machines.

Here we adapt these notions for fuzzy finite automata (FFAs). The D3-directing words obtained this way are precisely the directing words introduced by V.~Karthikeyan and M. Rajasekar (2015). With any FFA F we associate an NFA Fnd which has the same Di-directing words as F. Thus, if these definitions are used, the theory of directable FFAs reduces to that of NFAs.   We also introduce three new kinds of directing words of fuzzy automata that we call DD1-, DD2- and DD3-directing words, respectively which depend more on the fuzzy transition degrees between states. We establish some basic properties of the sets $DDi(F)$ of DDi-directing words of any given FFA F. In particular, it is shown that these languages are regular, and that DDi-directability is decidable. For so-called normal FFAs the languages DDi(F) are shown to have some special properties. Several relationships between the families of the corresponding sets DDi(F) of DDi-directing words are presented. We also determine the complete meet-semilattice of the various classes of DDi-directable FFAs and normal FFAs and their intersections."

This is particularly important for distributed systems with shared resources, e.g., one case can block another case competing for the same machine, leading to inter-case dependencies in performance. However, due to a variety of reasons, real-life systems often record only a subset of all events taking place. For example, to reduce costs, the number of sensors is minimized or parts of the system are not connected. To understand and analyze the behavior of processes with shared resources, we aim to reconstruct bounds for timestamps of events that must have happened but were not recorded. We present a novel approach that decomposes system runs into entity traces of cases and resources that may need to synchronize in the presence of many-to-many relationships. Such relationships occur, for example, in warehouses where packages for N incoming orders are not handled in a single delivery but in M different deliveries. We use linear programming over entity traces to derive the timestamps of unobserved events in an efficient manner. This helps to complete the event logs and facilitates analysis. We focus on material handling systems like baggage handling systems in airports to illustrate our approach. However, the approach can be applied to other settings where recording is incomplete. The ideas have been implemented in ProM and were evaluated using both synthetic and real-life event logs."
2021-02-25 18:58:29+00:00,2021-02-25 18:58:29+00:00,"Many problems in interprocedural program analysis can be modeled as the context-free language (CFL) reachability problem on graphs and can be solved in cubic time. Despite years of efforts, there are no known truly sub-cubic algorithms for this problem. We study the related certification task: given an instance of CFL reachability, are there small and efficiently checkable certificates for the existence and for the non-existence of a path? We show that, in both scenarios, there exist succinct certificates ($O(n^2)$ in the size of the problem) and these certificates can be checked in subcubic (matrix multiplication) time. The certificates are based on grammar-based compression of paths (for positive instances) and on invariants represented as matrix constraints (for negative instances). Thus, CFL reachability lies in nondeterministic and co-nondeterministic subcubic time.   A natural question is whether faster algorithms for CFL reachability will lead to faster algorithms for combinatorial problems such as Boolean satisfiability (SAT). As a consequence of our certification results, we show that there cannot be a fine-grained reduction from SAT to CFL reachability for a conditional lower bound stronger than $n^\omega$, unless the nondeterministic strong exponential time hypothesis (NSETH) fails.   Our results extend to related subcubic equivalent problems: pushdown reachability and two-way nondeterministic pushdown automata (2NPDA) language recognition. For example, we describe succinct certificates for pushdown non-reachability (inductive invariants) and observe that they can be checked in matrix multiplication time. We also extract a new hardest 2NPDA language, capturing the ""hard core"" of all these problems."

The latter is a network programming language based on a well-studied mathematical structure, namely, Kleene Algebra with Tests (KAT). Amongst others, the mathematical foundation of NetKAT gave rise to a sound and complete equational theory. In our setting, a safe behaviour is characterised by a NetKAT policy, or program, which does not enable forwarding packets from an ingress i to an undesirable egress e. We show how explanations for safety violations can be derived in an equational fashion, according to a modification of the existing NetKAT axiomatisation. We propose an approach based on the Maude system for actually computing the undesired behaviours witnessing the forwarding of packets from i to e as above. SDN-SafeCheck is a tool based on Maude equational theories satisfying important properties such as Church-Rosser and termination. SDN-SafeCheck automatically identifies all the undesired behaviours leading to e, covering forwarding paths up to a user specified size."

Linear temporal logic (LTL) is used to specify high-level tasks over infinite horizon, which can be converted into a limit deterministic generalized B\""uchi automaton (LDGBA) with several accepting sets. The novelty is to design an embedded product MDP (EP-MDP) between the LDGBA and the MDP by incorporating a synchronous tracking-frontier function to record unvisited accepting sets of the automaton, and to facilitate the satisfaction of the accepting conditions. The proposed LDGBA-based reward shaping and discounting schemes for the model-free reinforcement learning (RL) only depend on the EP-MDP states and can overcome the issues of sparse rewards. Rigorous analysis shows that any RL method that optimizes the expected discounted return is guaranteed to find an optimal policy whose traces maximize the satisfaction probability. A modular deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) is then developed to generate such policies over continuous state and action spaces. The performance of our framework is evaluated via an array of OpenAI gym environments."
2021-02-23 11:10:59+00:00,2021-02-23 11:10:59+00:00,"Esparza and Reiter have recently conducted a systematic comparative study of models of distributed computing consisting of a network of identical finite-state automata that cooperate to decide if the underlying graph of the network satisfies a given property. The study classifies models according to four criteria, and shows that twenty initially possible combinations collapse into seven equivalence classes with respect to their decision power, i.e. the properties that the automata of each class can decide. However, Esparza and Reiter only show (proper) inclusions between the classes, and so do not characterise their decision power. In this paper we do so for labelling properties, i.e. properties that depend only on the labels of the nodes, but not on the structure of the graph. In particular, majority (whether more nodes carry label $a$ than $b$) is a labelling property. Our results show that only one of the seven equivalence classes identified by Esparza and Reiter can decide majority for arbitrary networks. We then study the expressive power of the classes on bounded-degree networks, and show that three classes can. In particular, we present an algorithm for majority that works for all bounded-degree networks under adversarial schedulers, i.e. even if the scheduler must only satisfy that every node makes a move infinitely often, and prove that no such algorithm can work for arbitrary networks."

They allow users to exchange units of different types of crypto-assets, without the need to find a counter-party. There are several implementations and models for AMMs, featuring a variety of sophisticated economic mechanisms. We present a theory of AMMs. The core of our theory is an abstract operational model of the interactions between users and AMMs, which can be instantiated with any desired economic design mechanism. We exploit our theory to formally prove a set of fundamental properties of AMMs, characterizing both structural and economic aspects. We do this by abstracting from the actual economic mechanisms used in implementations, by identifying sufficient conditions which ensure the relevant properties. Notably, we devise a general solution to the arbitrage problem, the main game-theoretic foundation behind the economic mechanisms of AMMs."

We obtain two main characterizations of these sequences. The first one is concerned with $r$-block substitutions where $r$ morphisms are applied periodically. In particular, we provide examples of such sequences that are not morphic. The second characterization involves the factors, or subtrees of finite height, of the tree associated with the numeration system and decorated by the terms of the sequence."

The scenario in this work was captured from a long endurance USV surveillance mission using C-Enduro, an USV manufactured by ASV Ltd. The C-Enduro USV may encounter multiple non-deterministic and concurrent problems including lost communication signals, collision risk and malfunction. The vehicle is designed to utilise multiple energy sources from solar panel, wind turbine and diesel generator. The energy state can be affected by the solar irradiance condition, wind condition, states of the diesel generator, sea current condition and states of the USV. In this research, the states and the interactive relations between environmental uncertainties, sensors, USV energy system, USV and Ground Control Station (GCS) decision making systems are abstracted and modelled successfully using Kripke models. The desirable properties to be verified are expressed using temporal logic statement and finally the safety properties and the long endurance properties are verified using the model checker MCMAS, a model checker for multi-agent systems. The verification results are analyzed and show the feasibility of applying model checking method to retrospect the desirable property of the USV decision making system. This method could assist researcher to identify potential design error of decision making system in advance."

Several models (languages) for processes' specification in order to facilitate their distributed execution, have been proposed. LSAWfP is among the most recent in this area: it helps to specify administrative processes with grammatical models indicating, in addition to their fundamental elements, the permissions (reading, writing and execution) of each actor in relation to each of their tasks. In this paper, we present a model for a completely decentralized and artifact-centric execution of administrative processes specified using LSAWfP. The presented model puts particular emphasis on actors' views: it then allows the confidential execution of certain tasks by ensuring that, each actor potentially has only a partial perception of the processes' global execution states. The model thus solves a very important problem in business process execution, which is often sidelined in existing approaches. To accomplish this, the model rely on three projection algorithms allowing to partially replicate the processes' global execution states at a given moment, to consistently update the obtained partial states and to deduce new coherent global states. The proposal of these three algorithms, the proof of underlying mathematical tools' stability and a proposal of their implementation, are this paper's main contributions."

A problem is C-simple if it can be reduced to each problem in C. This can be viewed as a conceptual counterpart to C-hard problems to which all problems in C reduce. Our concrete example is the class of non-regular deterministic context-free languages (DCFL'), with a truth-table reduction by Mealy machines (which proves to be a preorder). The main technical result is a proof that the DCFL' language $L=\{0^n1^n; n\geq 1\}$ is DCFL'-simple, which can thus be viewed as the simplest problem in the class DCFL'. This result has already provided an application, to the computational model of neural networks 1ANN at the first level of analog neuron hierarchy. This model was proven not to recognize $L$, by using a specialized technical argument that can hardly be generalized to other languages in DCFL'. By the result that $L$ is DCFL'-simple, w.r.t. the reduction that can be implemented by 1ANN, we immediately obtain that 1ANN cannot accept any language in DCFL'. It thus seems worthwhile to explore if looking for C-simple problems in other classes C under suitable reductions could provide effective tools for expanding the lower-bound results known for single problems to the whole classes of problems."

Our contributions further the understanding of arena-independent finite-memory (AIFM) determinacy, i.e., the study of objectives for which memory is needed, but in a way that only depends on limited parameters of the game graphs. First, we show that objectives for which pure AIFM strategies suffice to play optimally also admit pure AIFM subgame perfect strategies. Second, we show that we can reduce the study of objectives for which pure AIFM strategies suffice in two-player stochastic games to the easier study of one-player stochastic games (i.e., Markov decision processes). Third, we characterize the sufficiency of AIFM strategies through two intuitive properties of objectives.

The existence of communication delays between supervisory controllers is unavoidable in a distributed application. The influence of these delays on the behavior of a supervisor is therefore studied using delay robustness theory.

Register automata process words over the domain, and along a run of the automaton, the registers can store data from the input word for later comparisons. It is long known that the universality problem, i.e., the problem to decide whether a given register automaton accepts all words over the domain, is undecidable. Recently, we proved the problem to be decidable in 2-ExpSpace if the register automaton under study is over $(\mathbb N;=)$ and unambiguous, i.e., every input word has at most one accepting run; this result was shortly after improved to 2-ExpTime by Barloy and Clemente. In this paper, we go one step further and prove that the problem is in ExpSpace, and in PSpace if the number of registers is fixed. Our proof is based on new techniques that additionally allow us to show that the problem is in PSpace for single-register automata over $(\mathbb Q;<)$. As a third technical contribution we prove that the problem is decidable (in ExpSpace) for a more expressive model of unambiguous register automata, where the registers can take values nondeterministically, if defined over $(\mathbb N;=)$ and only one register is used."

We show that the problem is in O(log log |w|) for languages in an algebraically-defined class QSG, and that it is in O(1) for another class QLZG. We show that languages not in QSG admit a reduction from the prefix problem for a cyclic group, so that they require \Omega(log n/ log log n) operations in the worst case; and that QSG languages not in QLZG admit a reduction from the prefix problem for the monoid U_1, which we conjecture cannot be maintained in O(1). This yields a conditional trichotomy. We also investigate intermediate cases between O(1) and O(log log n).

While classical results in logic are only interested in their existence, the question of how to effectively compute them is also interesting, important and useful for several applications. In the restricted case of Boolean propositional logic formula, this problem of synthesizing Boolean Skolem functions has been addressed in depth, with various recent work focussing on both theoretical and practical aspects of the problem. However, there are few existing results for the general case, and the focus has been on heuristical algorithms.   In this article, we undertake an investigation into the computational hardness of the problem of synthesizing Skolem functions for first order logic formula. We show that even under reasonable assumptions on the signature of the formula, it is impossible to compute or synthesize Skolem functions. Then we determine conditions on theories of first order logic which would render the problem computable. Finally, we show that several natural theories satisfy these conditions and hence do admit effective synthesis of Skolem functions."

Technically, we express such prior knowledge by linear hybrid automata (LHAs) - the LHAs are called bounding models. We introduce a novel notion of monitored language of LHAs, and we reduce the monitoring problem to the membership problem of the monitored language. We present two partial algorithms - one is via reduction to reachability in LHAs and the other is a direct one using polyhedra - and show that these methods, and thus the proposed model-bounded monitoring scheme, are efficient and practically relevant."

We show that for non-deterministic pushdown automata, this problem is 2-EXPTIME-complete and for deterministic pushdown automata, we show EXPTIME-completeness.   To prove the lower bounds, we first introduce (different variants of) subset-synchronisation and show that these problems are polynomial-time equivalent with the adaptive synchronisation problem. We then prove hardness results for the subset-synchronisation problems. For proving the upper bounds, we consider the problem of deciding if a given alternating pushdown system has an accepting run with at most $k$ leaves and we provide an $n^{O(k^2)}$ time algorithm for this problem."

To tackle these two classes of bugs, we propose formal model checking methods to guarantee that a high-level latency-insensitive design is unaffected by invalid input data and is free of deadlock. We develop a well-structured verification wrapper for each property to automatically construct the corresponding formal model for checking. Our experiments demonstrate that the formal checks are effective in realistic bug scenarios from high-level designs."

The other half -- validation (do we build the right software?) -- has been given comparatively little attention. While verification is the core of refinement-based formal methods, where each new refinement step must preserve all properties of its abstract model, validation is usually postponed until the latest stages of the development, when models can be automatically executed. Thus mistakes in requirements or in their interpretation are caught too late: usually at the end of the development process. In this paper, we present a novel approach to check compliance between requirements and their formal refinement-based specification during the earlier stages of development. Our proposed approach -- ""validation obligations"" -- is based on the simple idea that both verification and validation are an integral part of all refinement steps of a system."

These functions are called M-languages. M-languages are studied from the aspect of their recognition by deterministic finite automata whose components take values on M (M-DFAs). The characterization of an M-language l is based on providing a right congruence on Sigma* that is defined through l and a factorization on the set of all M-languages, L(Sigma*,M) (in sort L). A factorization on L is a pair of functions (g,f) such that, for each l in L, g(l). f(l)= l, where g(l) in M and f(l) in L. In essence, a factorization is a form of common factor extraction. A general Myhill-Nerode theorem, which is valid for any L(Sigma*, M), is provided. Basically, l is recognized by an M-DFA if and only if there exists a factorization on L, (g,f), such that the right congruence on Sigma* induced by the factorization (g,f) and f(l), has finite index. This paper shows that the existence of M-DFAs guarantees the existence of natural non-trivial factorizations on L without taking account any additional property on the monoid."
2021-02-08 17:10:24+00:00,2021-03-08 19:20:12+00:00,"We present a general framework for modelling and verifying epistemic properties over parameterized multi-agent systems that communicate by truthful public announcements. In our framework, the number of agents or the amount of certain resources are parameterized (i.e. not known a priori), and the corresponding verification problem asks whether a given epistemic property is true regardless of the instantiation of the parameters. For example, in a muddy children puzzle, one could ask whether each child will eventually find out whether (s)he is muddy, regardless of the number of children.   Our framework is regular model checking (RMC)-based, wherein synchronous finite-state automata (equivalently, monadic second-order logic over words) are used to specify the systems. We propose an extension of public announcement logic as specification language. Of special interests is the addition of the so-called iterated public announcement operators, which are crucial for reasoning about knowledge in parameterized systems. Although the operators make the model checking problem undecidable, we show that this becomes decidable when an appropriate ""disappearance relation"" is given. Further, we show how Angluin's L*-algorithm for learning finite automata can be applied to find a disappearance relation, which is guaranteed to terminate if it is regular. We have implemented the algorithm and apply this to such examples as the Muddy Children Puzzle, the Russian Card Problem, and Large Number Challenge."

However, many practical program verifiers are not based on operational semantics and can't seriously validate the program. Matching logic is proposed to make program verification based on operational semantics. In this paper, following Grigore Ro{\c{s}}u 's work, we consider matching logic for parallel imperative language(PIMP). According to our investigation, this paper is the first study on matching logic for PIMP. In our matching logic, we redefine ""interference-free"" to character parallel rule and prove the soundness of matching logic to the operational semantics of PIMP. We also link PIMP's operational semantics and PIMP's verification formally by constructing a matching logic verifier for PIMP which executes rewriting logic semantics symbolically on configuration patterns and is sound and complete to matching logic for PIMP. That is our matching logic verifier for PIMP is sound to the operational semantics of PIMP. Finally, we also verify the matching logic verifier through an example which is a standard problem in parallel programming."

Unlike for the language semantics, where every regular (that is, DFA-accepted) language is the interpretation of some regular expression, there are finite process graphs that are not bisimilar to the process interpretation of any regular expression. For reasoning about graphs that are expressible by regular expressions modulo bisimilarity it is desirable to have structural representations of process graphs in the image of the interpretation.   For '1-free' regular expressions, their process interpretations satisfy the structural property LEE (loop existence and elimination). But this is not in general the case for all regular expressions, as we show by examples. Yet as a remedy, we describe the possibility to recover the property LEE for a close variant of the process interpretation. For this purpose we refine the process semantics of regular expressions to yield process graphs with 1-transitions, similar to silent moves for finite-state automata."

Several notions of opacity have been introduced in the literature. We study the notions of language-based opacity, current-state opacity, initial-state opacity, initial-and-final-state opacity, K-step opacity, and infinite-step opacity. Comparing the notions is a natural question that has been investigated and summarized by Wu and Lafortune, who provided transformations among current-state opacity, initial-and-final-state opacity, and language-based opacity, and, for prefix-closed languages, also between language-based opacity and initial-state opacity. We extend these results by showing that all the discussed notions of opacity are transformable to each other. The transformations are computable in polynomial time, preserve the number of observable events, and determinism. Besides a deeper insight into the differences among the notions, the transformations have applications in complexity results. Namely, we improve the algorithmic complexity of deciding language-based opacity, infinite-step opacity, and K-step opacity, and provide a complete and improved complexity picture of the verification of the discussed notions of opacity."

In particular, the satisfaction of each of these signal temporal logic tasks depends on the behavior of a distinct set of agents. Instead of abstracting the agent dynamics and the temporal logic tasks into a discrete domain and solving the problem therein or using optimization-based methods, we derive collaborative feedback control laws. These control laws are based on a decentralized control barrier function condition that results in discontinuous control laws, as opposed to a centralized condition resembling the single-agent case. The benefits of our approach are inherent robustness properties typically present in feedback control as well as satisfaction guarantees for continuous-time multi-agent systems. More specifically, time-varying control barrier functions are used that account for the semantics of the signal temporal logic tasks at hand. For a certain fragment of signal temporal logic tasks, we further propose a systematic way to construct such control barrier functions.

It has recently been shown that IoT deployments are vulnerable to physical interactions, caused by design flaws or malicious intent, that can have severe physical consequences. Yet, extant approaches to securing IoT do not translate the app source code into its physical behavior to evaluate physical interactions. Thus, IoT consumers and markets do not possess the capability to assess the safety and security risks these interactions present. In this paper, we introduce the IoTSeer security service for IoT deployments, which uncovers undesired states caused by physical interactions. IoTSeer operates in four phases (1) translation of each actuation command and sensor event in an app source code into a hybrid I/O automaton that defines an app's physical behavior, (2) combining apps in a novel composite automaton that represents the joint physical behavior of interacting apps, (3) applying grid-based testing and falsification to validate whether an IoT deployment conforms to desired physical interaction policies, and (4) identification of the root cause of policy violations and proposing patches that guide users to prevent them.

For the intermediate model $\alpha$ANN of a binary-state NN that is extended with $\alpha\geq 0$ extra analog-state neurons with rational weights, we have established the analog neuron hierarchy 0ANNs $\subset$ 1ANNs $\subset$ 2ANNs $\subseteq$ 3ANNs. The separation 1ANNs $\subsetneqq$ 2ANNs has been witnessed by the non-regular deterministic context-free language (DCFL) $L_\#=\{0^n1^n\mid n\geq 1\}$ which cannot be recognized by any 1ANN even with real weights, while any DCFL (Chomsky level 2) is accepted by a 2ANN with rational weights. In this paper, we strengthen this separation by showing that any non-regular DCFL cannot be recognized by 1ANNs with real weights, which means (DCFLs $\setminus$ REG) $\subset$ (2ANNs $\setminus$ 1ANNs), implying 1ANNs $\cap$ DCFLs = 0ANNs.

In software engineering, PMC formulae can be used during design, e.g., to analyse the sensitivity of different system architectures to parametric variability, or to find optimal system configurations. They can also be used at runtime, e.g., to check if non-functional requirements are still satisfied after environmental changes, or to select new configurations after such changes. However, current PMC techniques do not scale well to systems with complex behaviour and more than a few parameters. Our paper introduces a fast PMC (fPMC) approach that overcomes this limitation, extending the applicability of PMC to a broader class of systems than previously possible. To this end, fPMC partitions the Markov models that PMC operates with into \emph{fragments} whose reachability properties are analysed independently, and obtains PMC reachability formulae by combining the results of these fragment analyses. To demonstrate the effectiveness of fPMC, we show how our fPMC tool can analyse three systems (taken from the research literature, and belonging to different application domains) with which current PMC techniques and tools struggle."

It establishes exact criteria for fixed-parameter tractability (fpt) evaluation of recursively enumerable classes of such OMQs (under the widely held Exponential Time Hypothesis). One of the main technical tools introduced in the paper is an fpt-reduction from deciding parameterized uniform CSPs to parameterized OMQ evaluation. A fundamental feature of the reduction is preservation of measures which are known to be essential for classifying classes of parameterized uniform CSPs: submodular width (according to the well known result of Marx for unbounded-arity schemas) and treewidth (according to the well known result of Grohe for bounded-arity schemas). As such, the reduction can be employed to obtain hardness results for evaluation of classes of parameterized OMQs both in the unbounded and in the bounded arity case. Previously, in the case of bounded arity schemas, this has been tackled using a technique requiring full introspection into the construction employed by Grohe."

However, no single tool has emerged as the dominant solution for system design. Each tool differs from the others in terms of the modeling language used, its verification capabilities and other complementary features, and each development context has peculiar needs that require different tools. This is particularly problematic for the railway industry, in which formal methods are highly recommended by the norms, but no actual guidance is provided for the selection of tools. To guide companies in the selection of the most appropriate formal tools to adopt in their contexts, a clear assessment of the features of the currently available tools is required.   To address this goal, this paper considers a set of 13 formal tools that have been used for railway system design, and it presents a systematic evaluation of such tools and a preliminary usability analysis of a subset of 7 tools, involving railway practitioners. The results are discussed considering the most desired aspects by industry and earlier related studies. While the focus is on the railway domain, the overall methodology can be applied to similar contexts. Our study thus contributes with a systematic evaluation of formal tools and it shows that despite the poor graphical interfaces, usability and maturity of the tools are not major problems, as claimed by contributions from the literature. Instead, support for process integration is the most relevant obstacle for the adoption of most of the tools."

Therefore, we present two shielding approaches for safe MARL. In centralized shielding, we synthesize a single shield to monitor all agents' joint actions and correct any unsafe action if necessary. In factored shielding, we synthesize multiple shields based on a factorization of the joint state space observed by all agents; the set of shields monitors agents concurrently and each shield is only responsible for a subset of agents at each step.Experimental results show that both approaches can guarantee the safety of agents during learning without compromising the quality of learned policies; moreover, factored shielding is more scalable in the number of agents than centralized shielding."

As compressed forms of the documents we use straight-line programs (SLPs) -- a lossless compression scheme for textual data widely used in different areas of theoretical computer science and particularly well-suited for algorithmics on compressed data. In terms of data complexity, our results are as follows. For a regular spanner M and an SLP S that represents a document D, we can solve the tasks of model checking and of checking non-emptiness in time O(size(S)). Computing the set M(D) of all span-tuples extracted from D can be done in time O(size(S) size(M(D))), and enumeration of M(D) can be done with linear preprocessing O(size(S)) and a delay of O(depth(S)), where depth(S) is the depth of S's derivation tree. Note that size(S) can be exponentially smaller than the document's size |D|; and, due to known balancing results for SLPs, we can always assume that depth(S) = O(log(|D|)) independent of D's compressibility. Hence, our enumeration algorithm has a delay logarithmic in the size of the non-compressed data and a preprocessing time that is at best (i.e., in the case of highly compressible documents) also logarithmic, but at worst still linear. Therefore, in a big-data perspective, our enumeration algorithm for SLP-compressed documents may nevertheless beat the known linear preprocessing and constant delay algorithms for non-compressed documents."

The uncertainties are considered in robot motion and environment properties, giving rise to the probabilistic labeled Markov decision process (MDP). A model-free reinforcement learning (RL) is developed to generate a finite-memory control policy to satisfy high-level tasks expressed in linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas. One of the novelties is to translate LTL into a limit deterministic generalized B\""uchi automaton (LDGBA) and develop a corresponding embedded LDGBA (E-LDGBA) by incorporating a tracking-frontier function to overcome the issue of sparse accepting rewards, resulting in improved learning performance without increasing computational complexity. Due to potentially conflicting tasks, a relaxed product MDP is developed to allow the agent to revise its motion plan without strictly following the desired LTL constraints if the desired tasks can only be partially fulfilled. An expected return composed of violation rewards and accepting rewards is developed. The designed violation function quantifies the differences between the revised and the desired motion planning, while the accepting rewards are designed to enforce the satisfaction of the acceptance condition of the relaxed product MDP. Rigorous analysis shows that any RL algorithm that optimizes the expected return is guaranteed to find policies that, in decreasing order, can 1) satisfy acceptance condition of relaxed product MDP and 2) reduce the violation cost over long-term behaviors. Also, we validate the control synthesis approach via simulation and experimental results."

Our external semantics is non-local, meaning that tokens are endowed with properties that say something about the global state of the net. We then prove, in both cases, that the internal and external constructions are equivalent, by using machinery built on top of the Grothendieck construction.

Deciding whether a given language $L \subseteq \Sigma^\omega$ can be expressed by an automaton of a desired class can be reduced to deciding a game between Prover and Refuter: in each turn of the game, Refuter provides a letter in $\Sigma$, and Prover responds with an annotation of the current state of the run (for example, in the case of B\""uchi automata, whether the state is accepting or rejecting, and in the case of parity automata, what the color of the state is). Prover wins if the sequence of annotations she generates is correct: it is an accepting run iff the word generated by Refuter is in $L$. We show how a winning strategy for Refuter can serve as a simple and easy-to-understand certificate to inexpressibility, and how it induces additional forms of certificates. Our framework handles all classes of deterministic automata, including ones with structural restrictions like weak automata. In addition, it can be used for refuting separation of two languages by an automaton of the desired class, and for finding automata that approximate $L$ and belong to the desired class."

We propose leafy automata as a dedicated automata-theoretic formalism for representing the game semantics of FICA. The automata use an infinite alphabet with a tree structure. We show that the game semantics of any FICA term can be represented by traces of a leafy automaton. Conversely, the traces of any leafy automaton can be represented by a FICA term. Because of the close match with FICA, we view leafy automata as a promising starting point for finding decidable subclasses of the language and, more generally, to provide a new perspective on models of higher-order concurrent computation. Moreover, we identify a fragment of FICA that is amenable to verification by translation into a particular class of leafy automata. Using a locality property of the latter class, where communication between levels is restricted and every other level is bounded, we show that their emptiness problem is decidable by reduction to Petri net reachability."

As a main consequence, we show decidability of safety, termination and boundedness verification for higher-order asynchronous programs -- such as OCaml programs using Lwt -- and undecidability of liveness verification already for order-2 asynchronous programs. We show that under mild assumptions, surprisingly, safety and termination verification of asynchronous programs with handlers from a language class are decidable iff emptiness is decidable for the underlying language class. Moreover, we show that configuration reachability and liveness (fair termination) verification are equivalent, and decidability of these problems implies decidability of the well-known ""equal-letters"" problem on languages.

Paper-and-pencil-based approaches and simulation tools, such as the Monte-Carlo approach, are commonly used to carry out CCD analysis, but lack the ability to rigorously verify essential system reliability properties. In this work, we propose to use formal techniques based on theorem proving for the formal modeling and step-analysis of CCDs to overcome the inaccuracies of the simulation-based analysis and the error-proneness of informal reasoning by mathematical proofs. In particular, we use the HOL4 theorem prover, which is a computer-based mathematical reasoning tool. To this end, we developed a formalization of CCDs in Higher-Order Logic (HOL), based on the algebraic approach, using HOL4. We demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed CCD formalization by performing the formal reliability analysis of the IEEE 39-bus electrical power network. Also, we formally determine the Forced Outage Rate (FOR) of the power generation units and the network reliability index, i.e., System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI). To assess the accuracy of our proposed approach, we compare our results with those obtained with MATLAB Monte-Carlo Simulation (MCS) as well as other state-of-the-art approaches for subsystem-level reliability analysis."

In this paper, we solve the long standing open problem of expressions capturing first order definable functions, thereby generalizing the seminal SF=AP (star free expressions = aperiodic languages) result of Sch\""utzenberger. Our result also generalizes a lesser known characterization by Sch\""utzenberger of aperiodic languages by SD-regular expressions (SD=AP). We show that every first order definable function over finite words captured by an aperiodic deterministic two-way transducer can be described with an SD-regular transducer expression (SDRTE). An SDRTE is a regular expression where Kleene stars are used in a restricted way: they can appear only on aperiodic languages which are prefix codes of bounded synchronization delay. SDRTEs are constructed from simple functions using the combinators unambiguous sum (deterministic choice), Hadamard product, and unambiguous versions of the Cauchy product and the k-chained Kleene-star, where the star is restricted as mentioned. In order to construct an SDRTE associated with an aperiodic deterministic two-way transducer, (i) we concretize Sch\""utzenberger's SD=AP result, by proving that aperiodic languages are captured by SD-regular expressions which are unambiguous and stabilising; (ii) by structural induction on the unambiguous, stabilising SD-regular expressions describing the domain of the transducer, we construct SDRTEs. Finally, we also look at various formalisms equivalent to SDRTEs which use the function composition, allowing to trade the k-chained star for a 1-star."

It is used extensively in test design, reverse engineering, and system identification. One type of the resulting artifact of this process for cyber-physical systems is hybrid automata. They are intuitive, precise, tool independent, and at a high level of abstraction, and can model systems with both discrete and continuous variables. In this paper, we propose a new technique for synthesizing hybrid automaton from the input-output traces of a non-linear cyber-physical system. Similarity detection in non-linear behaviors is the main challenge for extracting such models. We address this problem by utilizing the Dynamic Time Warping technique. Our approach is passive, meaning that it does not need interaction with the system during automata synthesis from the logged traces; and online, which means that each input/output trace is used only once in the procedure. In other words, each new trace can be used to improve the already synthesized automaton. We evaluated our algorithm in two industrial and simulated case studies. The accuracy of the derived automata show promising results."

The notion of computability is defined through Turing machines with infinite inputs which can produce the corresponding infinite outputs in the limit. We use non-deterministic transducers equipped with registers, an extension of register automata with outputs, to describe specifications. Being non-deterministic, such transducers may not define functions but more generally relations of data $\omega$-words. In order to increase the expressive power of these machines, we even allow guessing of arbitrary data values when updating their registers.   For functions over data $\omega$-words, we identify a sufficient condition (the possibility of determining the next letter to be outputted, which we call next letter problem) under which computability (resp. uniform computability) and continuity (resp. uniform continuity) coincide.   We focus on two kinds of data domains: first, the general setting of oligomorphic data, which encompasses any data domain with equality, as well as the setting of rational numbers with linear order; and second, the set of natural numbers equipped with linear order. For both settings, we prove that functionality, i.e. determining whether the relation recognized by the transducer is actually a function, is decidable. We also show that the so-called next letter problem is decidable, yielding equivalence between (uniform) continuity and (uniform) computability. Last, we provide characterizations of (uniform) continuity, which allow us to prove that these notions, and thus also (uniform) computability, are decidable. We even show that all these decision problems are PSpace-complete for (N,<) and for a large class of oligomorphic data domains, including for instance (Q,<)."

In this paper we investigate subsets named by a predicate $P$ such that the relation $P(x+y)$ has finite VC dimension. This provides a measure of complexity for binary strings with different properties than the standard string complexity function (based on diversity of substrings). We prove that strings of bounded VC dimension are meagre in the topology of the reals, provide simple rules for bounding the VC dimension of a string, and show that the bi-infinite strings of VC dimension $d$ are a non-sofic shift space. Additionally we characterize the irreducible strings of low VC dimension (0,1 and 2), and provide connections to mathematical logic."

We do so with chemistry in mind, looking at ways of modelling the behavior of chemical reactions that depend on enzymes to work. We prove that such nets can be either obtained as a result of a comonadic construction, or by enriching them with extra information encoded into a functor. We then use a well-established categorical result to prove that the two constructions are equivalent, and generalize them to the case where the firing of some transitions can ""regenerate"" the mana of others. This allows us to represent the action of catalysts and also of biochemical processes where the byproducts of some chemical reaction are exactly the enzymes that another reaction needs to work."

It is known that the set of all solutions of a given word equation with one variable is a finite union of sets of the form $\{\alpha w^i \beta \: : \: i \in \mathbb Z \}$, where $\alpha, w, \beta$ are reduced words over the alphabet of generators, and a polynomial-time algorithm (of a high degree) computing this set is known. We provide a cubic time algorithm for this problem, which also shows that the set of solutions consists of at most a quadratic number of the above-mentioned sets. The algorithm uses only simple tools of word combinatorics and group theory and is simple to state. Its analysis is involved and focuses on the combinatorics of occurrences of powers of a word within a larger word."

This paper introduces three critical properties of systems, called system connectivity, interaction soundness and data validity, and presents a related modeling and analysis method, based on a kind of Petri nets called VPN. For a given system, a model including component nets and interaction structure nets is constructed by using VPNs. The component net describes the internal process of each component, while the interaction structure net reflects the dynamic interaction between components. Based on this model, three properties are defined and analyzed. The case study of a practical mobile payment system shows the effectiveness of the proposed method."

However, because of their characteristics such as mobility and disconnection, it is difficult to model and analyze them by using a structure-fixed model. This work proposes a new Petri net model called Variable Petri Net (VPN) for modeling and analyzing these systems. The definition, firing rule, and related analysis technology of VPN are introduced in detail. In a VPN, the possible interaction interfaces are abstracted as a new kind of places called virtual places, and the occurrences of (dis)connections are described by new functions, which makes it appropriate to describe the component collaboration in systems and realize the scalability and pluggability of systems. Moreover, to overcome the shortcoming that markings cannot reflect link capability of a system, VPNs add a constraint function along with a marking to represent a complete system configuration. Several examples are used to demonstrate the newly proposed model and method."

We present dtControl 2.0, a new version with several fundamentally novel features. Most importantly, the user can now provide domain knowledge to be exploited in the decision tree learning process and can also interactively steer the process based on the dynamically provided information. To this end, we also provide a graphical user interface. It allows for inspection and re-computation of parts of the result, suggesting as well as receiving advice on predicates, and visual simulation of the decision-making process. Besides, we interface model checkers of probabilistic systems, namely Storm and PRISM and provide dedicated support for categorical enumeration-type state variables. Consequently, the controllers are more explainable and smaller."

Therefore, given a monoid $M$, it is natural to ask how long a sequence of elements of $M$ needs to be to ensure the presence of consecutive idempotent factors. This question is formalised through the notion of the Ramsey function $R_M$ associated to M, obtained by mapping every positive integer $k$ to the minimal integer $R_M(k)$ such that every word $u$ in $M^*$ of length $R_M(k)$ contains $k$ consecutive non-empty factors that correspond to the same idempotent element of $M$.   In this work, we study the behaviour of the Ramsey function $R_M$ by investigating the regular $D$-length of $M$, defined as the largest size $L(M)$ of a submonoid of $M$ isomorphic to the set of natural numbers $\{1,2, ..., L(M)\}$ equipped with the Max operation. We show that the regular $D$-length of $M$ determines the degree of $R_M$, by proving that $k^{L(M)} \leq R_M(k) \leq (k|M|^4)^{L(M)}$.   To allow applications of this result, we provide the value of the regular $D$-length of diverse monoids. In particular, we prove that the full monoid of $n \times n$ Boolean matrices, which is used to express transition monoids of non-deterministic automata, has a regular $D$-length of $\frac{n^2+n+2}{2}$."

Our analysis shows that interesting document behaviors can be easily formalized and detected thanks to STL formulas. We validate our idea on a dataset of 100K product signals.

A partial DFA is called synchronizing if it has a word (called a reset word) whose action brings a non-empty subset of states to a unique state and is undefined for all other states. While in the general case the problem of checking whether a partial DFA is synchronizing is PSPACE-complete, we show that in the strongly connected case this problem can be efficiently reduced to the same problem for a complete DFA. Using combinatorial, algebraic, and formal languages methods, we develop techniques that relate main synchronization problems for strongly connected partial DFAs with the same problems for complete DFAs. In particular, this includes the \v{C}ern\'{y} and the rank conjectures, the problem of finding a reset word, and upper bounds on the length of the shortest reset words of literal automata of finite prefix codes. We conclude that solving fundamental synchronization problems is equally hard in both models, as an essential improvement of the results for one model implies an improvement for the other."

We describe three forms of execution semantics in which pre-nets generate strict monoidal categories, $\Sigma$-nets (including whole-grain Petri nets) generate symmetric strict monoidal categories, and Petri nets generate commutative monoidal categories, all by left adjoint functors. We also construct adjunctions relating these categories of nets to each other, in particular showing that all kinds of net can be embedded in the unifying category of $\Sigma$-nets, in a way that commutes coherently with their execution semantics."

As an application, we prove decidability of the countable satisfiability problem for two-variable logic in the presence of a tree order, a linear order, and arbitrary atoms that are MSO definable from the tree order. As a consequence, the satisfiability problem for two-variable logic with arbitrary predicates, two of them interpreted by linear orders, is decidable."

2021-01-07 15:01:31+00:00,2021-01-07 15:01:31+00:00,"Logic locking is a hardware security technique to intellectual property (IP) against security threats in the IC supply chain, especially untrusted fabs. Such techniques incorporate additional locking circuitry within an IC that induces incorrect functionality when an incorrect key is provided. The amount of error induced is known as the effectiveness of the locking technique. ""SAT attacks"" provide a strong mathematical formulation to find the correct key of locked circuits. In order to achieve high SAT resilience(i.e. complexity of SAT attacks), many conventional logic locking schemes fail to inject sufficient error into the circuit. For example, in the case of SARLock and Anti-SAT, there are usually very few (or only one) input minterms that cause any error at the circuit output. The state-of-the-art stripped functionality logic locking (SFLL) technique introduced a trade-off between SAT resilience and effectiveness. In this work, we prove that such a trade-off is universal in logic locking. In order to attain high effectiveness of locking without compromising SAT resilience, we propose a novel logic locking scheme, called Strong Anti-SAT (SAS). In addition to SAT attacks, removal-based attacks are also popular against logic locking. Based on SAS, we propose Robust SAS (RSAS) which is resilient to removal attacks and maintains the same SAT resilience and as effectiveness as SAS. SAS and RSAS have the following significant improvements over existing techniques. (1) SAT resilience of SAS and RSAS against SAT attack is not compromised by increase in effectiveness. (2) In contrast to prior work focusing solely on the circuit-level locking impact, we integrate SAS-locked modules into a processor and show that SAS has a high application-level impact. (3) Our experiments show that SAS and RSAS exhibit better SAT resilience than SFLL and have similar effectiveness."

The obvious algorithmic approach to RPQ-evaluation (called PG-approach), i.e., constructing the product graph between an NFA for q and the graph database, is appealing due to its simplicity and also leads to efficient algorithms. However, it is unclear whether the PG-approach is optimal. We address this question by thoroughly investigating which upper complexity bounds can be achieved by the PG-approach, and we complement these with conditional lower bounds (in the sense of the fine-grained complexity framework). A special focus is put on enumeration and delay bounds, as well as the data complexity perspective. A main insight is that we can achieve optimal (or near optimal) algorithms with the PG-approach, but the delay for enumeration is rather high (linear in the database). We explore three successful approaches towards enumeration with sub-linear delay: super-linear preprocessing, approximations of the solution sets, and restricted classes of RPQs."

We argue that in many cases it may be better to replace the optimization problem with the {\em satisficing problem}, where instead of searching for optimal solutions, the goal is to search for solutions that adhere to a given threshold bound.   This work defines and investigates the satisficing problem on a two-player graph game with the discounted-sum cost model. We show that while the satisficing problem can be solved using numerical methods just like the optimization problem, this approach does not render compelling benefits over optimization. When the discount factor is, however, an integer, we present another approach to satisficing, which is purely based on automata methods. We show that this approach is algorithmically more performant -- both theoretically and empirically -- and demonstrates the broader applicability of satisficing overoptimization."

These characterizations answer along-standing open question posed by Yamashita and Kameda [YK96], and shed new light on the connection between coverings and the concepts of views and quotient graphs developed by the same authors. Characterizing conditions in terms of coverings is significant because it connects the field with a vast body of classical literature in graph theory and algebraic topology. In particular, it gives access to powerful tools such as Reidemeister's theorem and Mazurkiewicz's algorithm. Combined together, these tools allow us to present elegant proofs of otherwise intricate results, and their constructive nature makes them effectively usable in the algorithms. This paper also gives us the opportunity to present the field of covering theory in a pedagogical way, with a focus on the two aforementioned tools, whose potential impact goes beyond the specific problems considered in this work."

We show that the universality and the inclusion problems can be solved with 2-EXPTIME complexity when the input automata are without guessing and unambiguous, improving on the currently best-known 2-EXPSPACE upper bound by Mottet and Quaas. When the number of registers of both automata is fixed, we obtain a lower EXPTIME complexity, also improving the EXPSPACE upper bound from Mottet and Quaas for fixed number of registers. We reduce inclusion to universality, and then we reduce universality to the problem of counting the number of orbits of runs of the automaton. We show that the orbit-counting function satisfies a system of bidimensional linear recursive equations with polynomial coefficients (linrec), which generalises analogous recurrences for the Stirling numbers of the second kind, and then we show that universality reduces to the zeroness problem for linrec sequences. While such a counting approach is classical and has successfully been applied to unambiguous finite automata and grammars over finite alphabets, its application to register automata over infinite alphabets is novel. We provide two algorithms to decide the zeroness problem for bidimensional linear recursive sequences arising from orbit-counting functions. Both algorithms rely on techniques from linear non-commutative algebra. The first algorithm performs variable elimination and has elementary complexity. The second algorithm is a refined version of the first one and it relies on the computation of the Hermite normal form of matrices over a skew polynomial field. The second algorithm yields an EXPTIME decision procedure for the zeroness problem of linrec sequences, which in turn yields the claimed bounds for the universality and inclusion problems of register automata."

This result yields lower bounds for the binomial language of all words with exactly $k$ ones and $n-k$ zeros and for the language of all Dyck words of length $2n$. We also determine the blow-up of language operations (intersection and shuffle) of regular expressions for finite languages. Second, we adapt a lower bound method for multilinear arithmetic formulas by so-called log-product polynomials to regular expressions. With this method we show almost tight lower bounds for the language of all binary numbers with $n$ bits that are divisible by a given odd integer $p$, for the language of all words of length $n$ over a $k$ letter alphabet with an even number of occurrences of each letter and for the language of all permutations of $\{1,\dots, n\}$."

These characteristics play a crucial role in applications of automata theory. For example, certain acceptance conditions can be handled more efficiently than others by dedicated tools and algorithms. Furthermore, some applications, such as synthesis and probabilistic model checking, require that properties are represented as some type of deterministic omega-automata. However, properties cannot always be represented by automata with the desired acceptance condition and determinism. In this paper we study the problem of approximating linear-time properties by automata in a given class. Our approximation is based on preserving the language up to a user-defined precision given in terms of the size of the finite lasso representation of infinite executions that are preserved. We study the state complexity of different types of approximating automata, and provide constructions for the approximation within different automata classes, for example, for approximating a given automaton by one with a simpler acceptance condition."

For trace properties, algorithms for verification, monitoring, and synthesis are typically based on a representation of the properties as omega-automata. For hyperproperties, a similar, canonical automata-theoretic representation is, so far, missing. This is a serious obstacle for the development of algorithms, because basic constructions, such as learning algorithms, cannot be applied.   In this paper, we present a canonical representation for the widely used class of regular k-safety hyperproperties, which includes important polices such as noninterference. We show that a regular k-safety hyperproperty S can be represented by a finite automaton, where each word accepted by the automaton represents a violation of S. The representation provides an automata-theoretic approach to regular k-safety hyperproperties and allows us to compare regular k-safety hyperproperties, simplify them, and learn such hyperproperties. We investigate the problem of constructing automata for regular k-safety hyperproperties in general and from formulas in HyperLTL, and provide complexity bounds for the different translations. We also present a learning algorithm for regular k-safety hyperproperties based on the L* learning algorithm for deterministic finite automata."

However, writing these validators can pose a challenge to some users. We present FOREST, a regular expression synthesizer for digital form validations. FOREST produces a regular expression that matches the desired pattern for the input values and a set of conditions over capturing groups that ensure the validity of integer values in the input. Our synthesis procedure is based on enumerative search and uses a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver to explore and prune the search space. We propose a novel representation for regular expressions synthesis, multi-tree, which induces patterns in the examples and uses them to split the problem through a divide-and-conquer approach. We also present a new SMT encoding to synthesize capture conditions for a given regular expression. To increase confidence in the synthesized regular expression, we implement user interaction based on distinguishing inputs. We evaluated FOREST on real-world form-validation instances using regular expressions. Experimental results show that FOREST successfully returns the desired regular expression in 72% of the instances and outperforms REGEL, a state-of-the-art regular expression synthesizer."

While this is not possible in finite Markov Decision Process (MDP), it can be satisfied in countably infinite ones, e.g., if the transition graph is acyclic. We prove the following fundamental properties of Transience in countably infinite MDPs.   1. There exist uniformly $\epsilon$-optimal MD strategies (memoryless deterministic) for Transience, even in infinitely branching MDPs.   2. Optimal strategies for Transience need not exist, even if the MDP is finitely branching. However, if an optimal strategy exists then there is also an optimal MD strategy.   3. If an MDP is universally transient (i.e., almost surely transient under all strategies) then many other objectives have a lower strategy complexity than in general MDPs. E.g., $\epsilon$-optimal strategies for Safety and co-B\""uchi and optimal strategies for $\{0,1,2\}$-Parity (where they exist) can be chosen MD, even if the MDP is infinitely branching."

We first recall several methods of conversion from expressions to automata, enlightening the similarities between the words and trees cases. We then produce an original study of the power of enriched category theory applied 1) to automata and expressions implementation, and 2) to the study of associated algorithms, using advanced concepts of functional programming, while simultaneously constructing a Haskell implementation of notions of enriched category theory and associated automata. More precisely, the Haskell implementation and the algebraic definition of the generic automaton structure are based on the following ideas:   - enriched categories, enriched functors, enriched monads, etc. can be implemented in Haskell;   - Type level programming can be used to properly encode function arity;   - monoids (word structure) and operads (tree structure) can be encoded as monoid objects;   - tree and word automata can be represented by the same algebraic structure, via enriched categories.   This generalization leads to surprising remarks. As an example, some classical algorithms (determinization, completion, conversion from alternating to deterministic automaton) can be regrouped in only one function. We will then define a notion of generalized expressions based on the notion of monoidal tensor product.   Haskell sources are available at: http://ludovicmignot.free.fr/HDR/src-HDR.zip"

We provide a detailed analysis of transparency obligations from the GDPR to identify the expressiveness required for a formal transparency language intended to meet respective legal requirements. In addition, we identify a set of further, non-functional requirements that need to be met to foster practical adoption in real-world (web) information systems engineering. On this basis, we specify our formal language and present a respective, fully implemented toolkit around it. We then evaluate the practical applicability of our language and toolkit and demonstrate the additional prospects it unlocks through two different use cases: a) the inter-organizational analysis of personal data-related practices allowing, for instance, to uncover data sharing networks based on explicitly announced transparency information and b) the presentation of formally represented transparency information to users through novel, more comprehensible, and potentially adaptive user interfaces, heightening data subjects' actual informedness about data-related practices and, thus, their sovereignty.   Altogether, our transparency information language and toolkit allow - differently from previous work - to express transparency information in line with actual legal requirements and practices of modern (web) information systems engineering and thereby pave the way for a multitude of novel possibilities to heighten transparency and user sovereignty in practice."
2020-12-18 12:18:25+00:00,2020-12-18 12:18:25+00:00,"Concurrency and probability are both much studied extensions of sequential computation. Within concurrency theory, there is a broad divide between interleaving models and logics, which model concurrency by non-determinism, and `truly concurrent' models, in which concurrency (and/or causality) are directly represented. True concurrency gives much richer models and logics, but is also harder to work with, as the interactions of causality and concurrency can become complex.   In probabilistic computation, we have by now many well understood probabilistic models and logics on interleaving models, developed over the last thirty years or so. However, for true concurrency, adding probability has been much harder, owing to the interactions between probabilistic independence and causal/concurrent independence, piling both conceptual and technical difficulties upon an already complex model. Various notions of, e.g., probabilistic Petri net have been introduced, but for simpler cases such as free-choice nets.   A significant contribution in the last decade was Abbes and Benveniste 2006, which gave a rigorous foundation for probabilistic concurrency in terms of Winskel's event structures, which can be seen as the lowest level of concurrent/causal modelling. However, event structures are themselves not ideal for representing richer high-level models such as (arbitrary) Petri nets, as the concurrency is derived from a binary conflict relation.   Here we develop an extension of the theory of Abbes and Benveniste to a more general class of models, a certain subclass of `stable event structures'. This class is sufficient to give a semantics to probabilistic Petri nets (including the notoriously awkward notion of confusion, which is forbidden by free-choice nets), and thereby allows the definition of general probabilistic logics for Petri nets."

We also prove analogous results for other sequences, including the Thue-Morse sequence and the Tribonacci sequence.   We also provide general upper and lower bounds on string attractor size for different kinds of sequences. For example, if $\bf s$ has a finite appearance constant, then there is a string attractor for ${\bf s}[0..n-1]$ of size $O(\log n)$. If further $\bf s$ is linearly recurrent, then there is a string attractor for ${\bf s}[0..n-1]$ of size $O(1)$. For automatic sequences, the size of the smallest string attractor for ${\bf s}[0..n-1]$ is either $\Theta(1)$ or $\Theta(\log n)$, and it is decidable which case occurs. Finally, we close with some remarks about greedy string attractors."

Their definition is based on a notion of $\mathcal{S}$-kernel that extends that of $b$-kernel. However, this definition does not allow us to generalize all of the many characterizations of $b$-regular sequences. In this paper, we present an alternative definition of $\mathcal{S}$-kernel, and hence an alternative definition of $\mathcal{S}$-regular sequences, which enables us to use recognizable formal series in order to generalize most (if not all) known characterizations of $b$-regular sequences to abstract numeration systems. We then give two characterizations of $\mathcal{S}$-automatic sequences as particular $\mathcal{S}$-regular sequences. Next, we present a general method to obtain various families of $\mathcal{S}$-regular sequences by enumerating $\mathcal{S}$-recognizable properties of $\mathcal{S}$-automatic sequences. As an example of the many possible applications of this method, we show that, provided that addition is $\mathcal{S}$-recognizable, the factor complexity of an $\mathcal{S}$-automatic sequence defines an $\mathcal{S}$-regular sequence. In the last part of the paper, we study $\mathcal{S}$-synchronized sequences. Along the way, we prove that the formal series obtained as the composition of a synchronized relation and a recognizable series is recognizable. As a consequence, the composition of an $\mathcal{S}$-synchronized sequence and a $\mathcal{S}$-regular sequence is shown to be $\mathcal{S}$-regular. All our results are presented in an arbitrary dimension $d$ and for an arbitrary semiring $\mathbb{K}$."

As an information-flow property, the underlying observation model is the key in the modeling and analysis of opacity. In this paper, we investigate the verification of current-state opacity for discrete-event systems under Orwellian-type observations, i.e., the system is allowed to re-interpret the observation of an event based on its future suffix. First, we propose a new Orwellian-type observation model called the dynamic information release mechanism (DIRM). In the DIRM, when to release previous ""hold on"" events is state-dependent. Then we propose a new definition of opacity based on the notion of history-equivalence rather than the standard projection-equivalence. This definition is more suitable for observations that are not prefix-closed. Finally, we show that by constructing a new structure called the DIRM-observer, current-state opacity can be effectively verified under the DIRM. Computational complexity analysis as well as illustrative examples for the proposed approach are also provided. Compared with the existing Orwellian-type observation model, the proposed framework is more general in the sense that the information-release-mechanism is state-dependent and the corresponding definition of opacity is more suitable for non-prefix-closed observations."

This paper uses grammars extended with conjunction and negation operators, known as conjunctive grammars and Boolean grammars, to describe the set of well-formed programs in a simple typeless procedural programming language. A complete Boolean grammar, which defines such concepts as declaration of variables and functions before their use, is constructed and explained. Using the Generalized LR parsing algorithm for Boolean grammars, a program can then be parsed in time $O(n^4)$ in its length, while another known algorithm allows subcubic-time parsing. Next, it is shown how to transform this grammar to an unambiguous conjunctive grammar, with square-time parsing. This becomes apparently the first specification of the syntax of a programming language entirely by a computationally feasible formal grammar."

In this paper, we introduce a weak Greibach normal form, whose definition corresponds to the lexicalized normal form for string grammars, and prove that every context-free hypergraph language (with nonsubstantial exceptions) can be generated by a grammar in this normal form.

The topological properties are the same as for the lower half-levels of the quantifier alternation hierarchy without the two-variable restriction (i.e., the Cantor topology and the alphabetic topology).

We show that probabilistic grammars can be used to elegantly and flexibly formulate the parsimony principle, that favors simpler equations, through probabilities attached to the rules in the grammars.

Using a hybrid barrier certificate, we propose a solution to the original problem. Simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

SceneChecker uses symmetry abstractions, a novel refinement algorithm, and importantly, is built to boost the performance of any existing reachability analysis tool as a plug-in subroutine. We evaluated SceneChecker on several scenarios involving ground and aerial vehicles with nonlinear dynamics and neural network controllers, employing different kinds of symmetries, using different reachability subroutines, and following plans with hundreds of way-points in complex workspaces. Compared to two leading tools, DryVR and Flow*, SceneChecker shows 20x speedup in verification time, even while using those very tools as reachability subroutines."

Since this model can be seen as a generalization of finite automata to 2D languages, a logical approach is to proceed in two steps. The first one is to develop a 2D pumping lemma and the second one is to use this pumping lemma to classify the different types of possible computation.   Previously, Meunier at al have proven a pumping lemma and Doty et al, assuming the existence of a pumping lemma, have classified the different types of terminal assembly. Thus the combination of these two papers solves the directed temperature 1 conjecture ... but in an imperfect way. Indeed, since the work of Doty et al is anterior to the pumping lemma of Meunier et al, the authors assumed a different and stronger pumping lemma. Nevertheless, all the demonstrations made in Doty et al still hold with the pumping lemma of Meunier et al.   In this paper, we harmonize the notations between these two articles in order to clearly solve the directed temperature 1 conjecture. We are also able to give an optimal description of the bi-periodic structures which may appear in some tile assembly system."

A celebrated theorem by Agafonov states that a sequence {\alpha} is normal iff every finite-state selector. Normality is generalised to arbitrary probability maps \mu: {\alpha} is is \mu-distributed if, for every finite string w, the limiting frequency of w in {\alpha} exists and equals \mu(w). Unlike normality, \mu-distributedness is not preserved by finite-state selectors for all probability maps \mu. This raises the question of how to characterize the probability maps \mu for which \mu-distributedness is preserved across finite-state selection, or equivalently, by selection by programs using constant space.   We prove the following result: for any finite or countably infinite alphabet {\Sigma}, every finite-state selector over {\Sigma} selects a \mu-distributed sequence from every \mu-distributed sequence {\alpha} iff \mu is induced by a Bernoulli distribution on {\Sigma}, that is a probability distribution on the alphabet extended to words by taking the product. The primary -- and remarkable -- consequence of our main result is a complete characterization of the set of probability maps, on finite and infinite alphabets, for which Agafonov-type results hold. The main positive takeaway is that (the appropriate generalization of) Agafonov's Theorem holds for Bernoulli distributions (rather than just equidistributions) on both finite and countably infinite alphabets. As a further consequence, we obtain a result in the area of symbolic dynamical systems: the shift-invariant measures {\nu} on {\Sigma}^{\omega} such that any finite-state selector preserves the property of genericity for {\mu}, are exactly the positive Bernoulli measures."

In this work we address the first problem. We restrict attention to structurally unambiguous weighted context-free grammars (SUWCFG) and provide a query learning algorithm for structurally unambiguous probabilistic context-free grammars (SUPCFG). We show that SUWCFG can be represented using co-linear multiplicity tree automata (CMTA), and provide a polynomial learning algorithm that learns CMTAs. We show that the learned CMTA can be converted into a probabilistic grammar, thus providing a complete algorithm for learning a structurally unambiguous probabilistic context free grammar (both the grammar topology and the probabilistic weights) using structured membership queries and structured equivalence queries.

The reachability problem asks for the existence of an assignment of the parameters to the non-negative integers such that reachability holds in the underlying timed automaton. The reachability problem for PTA is long known to be undecidable, already over three parametric clocks.   A few years ago, Bundala and Ouaknine proved that for PTA over two parametric clocks and one parameter the reachability problem is decidable and also showed a lower bound for the complexity class PSPACE^NEXP. Our main result is that the reachability problem for two-parametric timed automata with one parameter is EXPSPACE-complete. Our contribution is two-fold.   For the EXPSPACE lower bound we make use of deep results from complexity theory, namely a serializability characterization of EXPSPACE (based on Barrington's Theorem) and a logspace translation of numbers in chinese remainder representation to binary representation.   For the EXPSPACE upper bound, we give a careful exponential time reduction from PTA over two parametric clocks and one parameter to a slight subclass of parametric one-counter automata (POCA) over one parameter based on a minor adjustment of a construction due to Bundala and Ouaknine. We provide a series of techniques to partition a fictitious run of a POCA into several carefully chosen subruns that allow us to prove that it is sufficient to consider a parameter value of exponential magnitude only. This allows us to show a doubly-exponential upper bound on the value of the only parameter of a PTA over two parametric clocks and one parameter. We hope that extensions of our techniques lead to finally establishing decidability of the long-standing open problem of reachability in parametric timed automata with two parametric clocks (and arbitrarily many parameters)."

The (global) state reachability problem for DCPS is undecidable in general, but Atig et al. (2009) showed that it becomes decidable, and is in 2EXPSPACE, when each thread is restricted to a fixed number of context switches. The best known lower bound for the problem is EXPSPACE-hard and this lower bound follows already when each thread is a finite-state machine and runs atomically to completion (i.e., does not switch contexts). In this paper, we close the gap by showing that state reachability is 2EXPSPACE-hard already with only one context switch. Interestingly, state reachability analysis is in EXPSPACE both for pushdown threads without context switches as well as for finite-state threads with arbitrary context switches. Thus, recursive threads together with a single context switch provide an exponential advantage.   Our proof techniques are of independent interest for 2EXPSPACE-hardness results. We introduce transducer-defined Petri nets, a succinct representation for Petri nets, and show coverability is 2EXPSPACE-hard for this model. To show 2EXPSPACE-hardness, we present a modified version of Lipton's simulation of counter machines by Petri nets, where the net programs can make explicit recursive procedure calls up to a bounded depth."

Our main result shows that context-bounded fair termination is decidable for the model; context-bounded implies that each spawned thread can be context switched a fixed constant number of times. Our proof is technical, since fair termination requires reasoning about the composition of unboundedly many threads each with unboundedly large stacks. In fact, techniques for related problems, which depend crucially on replacing the pushdown threads with finite-state threads, are not applicable. Instead, we introduce an extension of vector addition systems with states (VASS), called VASS with balloons (VASSB), as an intermediate model; it is an infinite-state model of independent interest. A VASSB allows tokens that are themselves markings (balloons). We show that context bounded fair termination reduces to fair termination for VASSB. We show the latter problem is decidable by showing a series of reductions: from fair termination to configuration reachability for VASSB and thence to the reachability problem for VASS. For a lower bound, fair termination is known to be non-elementary already in the special case where threads run to completion (no context switches).   We also show that the simpler problem of context-bounded termination is 2EXPSPACE-complete, matching the complexity bound---and indeed the techniques---for safety verification. Additionally, we show the related problem of fair starvation, which checks if some thread can be starved along a fair run, is also decidable in the context-bounded case. The decidability employs an intricate reduction from fair starvation to fair termination. Like fair termination, this problem is also non-elementary."

The main difference between Context-Free Grammars (CFGs) and PEGs relies on the interpretation of the choice operator: while the CFGs' unordered choice e | e' is interpreted as the union of the languages recognized by e and e, the PEGs' prioritized choice e/e' discards e' if e succeeds. Such subtle, but important difference, changes the language recognized and yields more efficient parsing algorithms. This paper proposes a rewriting logic semantics for PEGs. We start with a rewrite theory giving meaning to the usual constructs in PEGs. Later, we show that cuts, a mechanism for controlling backtracks in PEGs, finds also a natural representation in our framework. We generalize such mechanism, allowing for both local and global cuts with a precise, unified and formal semantics. Hence, our work strives at better understanding and controlling backtracks in parsers for PEGs. The semantics we propose is executable and, besides being a parser with modest efficiency, it can be used as a playground to test different optimization ideas. More importantly, it is a mathematical tool that can be used for different analyses."

A byproduct of this simple toy-model is a general discrete analog of the Stokes law. Moreover we prove that in the spacetime limit, the automaton converges to a Dirac free Hamiltonian.

Contemporary automotive design and safety engineering best practices are suitable for analyzing system components in isolation, whereas today's highly complex and interdependent AD systems require novel approach to ensure resilience to multi-point failures. We present a holistic safety concept unifying advanced safety measures for handling multiple-point faults. Our proposed approach enables designers to focus on more pressing issues such as handling fault-free hazardous behavior associated with system performance limitations. To verify our approach, we developed an executable model of the safety concept in the formal specification language mCRL2. The model behavior is governed by a four-mode degradation policy controlling distributed processors, redundant communication networks, and virtual machines. To keep the vehicle as safe as possible our degradation policy can reduce driving comfort or AD system's availability using additional low-cost driving channels. We formalized five safety requirements in the modal mu-calculus and proved them against our mCRL2 model, which is intractable to accomplish exhaustively using traditional road tests or simulation techniques. In conclusion, our formally proven safety concept defines a holistic design pattern for designing AD systems."

This paper extends and generalizes these results by introducing a pair of occupancy measures to express the LTL satisfaction objective and the expected discounted reward objective, respectively. These occupancy measures are then connected to a single policy via a novel reduction resulting in a mixed integer linear program whose solution provides an optimal policy.

This yields a new generic $L^*$-like algorithm which can be instantiated for learning deterministic automata, automata weighted over fields, as well as subsequential transducers. The generic nature of our algorithm is obtained by adopting an approach in which automata are simply functors from a particular category representing words to a ""computation category"". We establish that the sufficient properties for yielding the existence of minimal automata (that were disclosed in a previous paper), in combination with some additional hypotheses relative to termination, ensure the correctness of our generic algorithm."

The core spanners (introduced by Fagin, Kimelfeld, Reiss, and Vansummeren (PODS 2013, JACM 2015) as a formalisation of the core functionality of the query language AQL used in IBM's SystemT) additionally need string equality selections and it has been shown by Freydenberger and Holldack (ICDT 2016, Theory of Computing Systems 2018) that this leads to high complexity and even undecidability of the typical problems in static analysis and query evaluation. We propose an alternative approach to core spanners: by incorporating the string-equality selections directly into the regular language that represents the underlying regular spanner (instead of treating it as an algebraic operation on the table extracted by the regular spanner), we obtain a fragment of core spanners that, while having slightly weaker expressive power than the full class of core spanners, arguably still covers the intuitive applications of string equality selections for information extraction and has much better upper complexity bounds of the typical problems in static analysis and query evaluation."

However, there are no commonly accepted modelling tools (languages). Some of them are criticized for their inability to capture both the lifecycle, informational and organizational models of processes. For some others, process modelling is generally done using a single graph; this does not facilitate modularity, maintenance and scalability. In addition, some of these languages are very general; hence, their application to specific domain processes (such as administrative processes) is very complex. In this paper, we present a new language and a new methodology, dedicated to administrative process modelling. This language is based on a variant of attributed grammars and is able to capture the lifecycle, informational and organizational models of such processes. Also, it proposes a simple graphical formalism allowing to model each process's execution scenario as an annotated tree (modularity). In the new language, a particular emphasis is put on modelling (using ""views"") the perceptions that actors have on processes and their data."

Past approaches have focussed on synchronous analyses, i.e. techniques in which different paths are compared lockstepwise. In this paper, we systematically study asynchronous analyses for hyperproperties by introducing both a novel automata model (Alternating Asynchronous Parity Automata) and the temporal fixpoint calculus $\Hmu$, the first fixpoint calculus that can systematically express hyperproperties in an asynchronous manner and at the same time subsumes the existing logic HyperLTL. We show that the expressive power of both models coincides over fixed path assignments. The high expressive power of both models is evidenced by the fact that decision problems of interest are highly undecidable, i.e. not even arithmetical. As a remedy, we propose approximative analyses for both models that also induce natural decidable fragments."

Recent work has shown that both representations can be combined and then allow multiple stochastic firings. This work presents an algorithm for building the Parametric Location Tree with multiple general transition firings and shows how its transient probability distribution can be computed using multi-dimensional integration. We discuss the (dis-)advantages of an interval arithmetic and a geometric approach to compute the areas of integration. Furthermore, we provide details on how to perform a Monte Carlo integration either directly on these intervals or convex polytopes, or after transformation to standard simplices. A case study on a battery-backup system shows the feasibility of the approach and discusses the performance of the different integration approaches."

They relate tightly to formalisms over nominal sets, such as nondetermininistic orbit-finite automata (NOFAs), where names play the role of data. Reasoning problems in such formalisms tend to be computationally hard. Name-binding nominal automata models such as regular nondeterministic automata (RNNAs) have been shown to be computationally more tractable. In the present paper, we introduce a linear-time logic Bar-muTL for finite words over an infinite alphabet, which features full negation and freeze quantification via name binding. We show by reduction to extended regular nondeterministic nominal automata that even though Bar-muTL allows liveness constraints, unrestricted nondeterminism, and unboundedly many registers, model checking Bar-muTL over RNNAs and satisfiability checking both have elementary complexity. E.g., model checking is in ExpSpace, more precisely in parametrized PSpace, effectively with the number of registers as the parameter."

In the category theoretic formulation of universal algebra, vector spaces are the Eilenberg-Moore algebras over the free vector space monad on the category of sets. In this paper we show that the notion of a basis can be extended to algebras of arbitrary monads on arbitrary categories. On the one hand, we establish purely algebraic results, for instance about the existence and uniqueness of bases and the representation of algebra morphisms. On the other hand, we use the general notion of a basis in the context of coalgebraic systems and show that a basis for the underlying algebra of a bialgebra gives rise to an equivalent free bialgebra. As a result, we are, for instance, able to recover known constructions from automata theory, namely the so-called canonical residual finite state automaton. Finally, we instantiate the framework to a variety of example monads, including the powerset, downset, distribution, and neighbourhood monad."

We first present an intrinsic relation between WFA and the tensor train decomposition, a particular form of tensor network. This relation allows us to exhibit a novel low rank structure of the Hankel matrix of a function computed by a WFA and to design an efficient spectral learning algorithm leveraging this structure to scale the algorithm up to very large Hankel matrices. We then unravel a fundamental connection between WFA and second-order recurrent neural networks~(2-RNN): in the case of sequences of discrete symbols, WFA and 2-RNN with linear activation functions are expressively equivalent. Furthermore, we introduce the first provable learning algorithm for linear 2-RNN defined over sequences of continuous input vectors. This algorithm relies on estimating low rank sub-blocks of the Hankel tensor, from which the parameters of a linear 2-RNN can be provably recovered. The performances of the proposed learning algorithm are assessed in a simulation study on both synthetic and real-world data."

Parys (2019) has developed an ingenious quasi-polynomial McNaughton- Zielonka-style algorithm, and Lehtinen et al. (2019) have improved its worst-case runtime. Jurdzi\'nski and Morvan (2020) have recently brought forward a generic attractor-based algorithm, formalizing a second class of quasi-polynomial solutions to solving parity games, which have runtime quadratic in the size of universal trees. First, we adapt the framework of iterative lifting algorithms to computing attractor-based strategies. Second, we design a symmetric lifting algorithm in this setting, in which two lifting iterations, one for each player, accelerate each other in a recursive fashion. The symmetric algorithm performs at least as well as progress-measure liftings in the worst-case, whilst bypassing their inherent asymmetric limitation. Thirdly, we argue that the behaviour of the generic attractor-based algorithm of Jurdzinski and Morvan (2020) can be reproduced by a specific deceleration of our symmetric lifting algorithm, in which some of the information collected by the algorithm is repeatedly discarded. This yields a novel interpretation of McNaughton-Zielonka-style algorithms as progress-measure lifting iterations (with deliberate set-backs), further strengthening the ties between all known quasi-polynomial algorithms to date."

Given a query and the data, the task is to preprocess the data and then enumerate all the answers to the query one by one and without repetitions. This enumeration scheme is typically useful when the solutions are treated on the fly or when we want to stop the enumeration once the pertinent solutions have been found. However, with the current schemes, there is no restriction on the order how the solutions are given and this order usually depends on the techniques used and not on the relevance for the user.   In this paper we study the enumeration of monadic second order logic (MSO) over words when the solutions are ranked. We present a framework based on MSO cost functions that allows to express MSO formulae on words with a cost associated with each solution. We then demonstrate the generality of our framework which subsumes, for instance, document spanners and regular complex event processing queries and adds ranking to them. The main technical result of the paper is an algorithm for enumerating all the solutions of formulae in increasing order of cost efficiently, namely, with a linear preprocessing phase and logarithmic delay between solutions. The novelty of this algorithm is based on using functional data structures, in particular, by extending functional Brodal queues to suit with the ranked enumeration of MSO on words."

We are interested in various restrictions on learning, such as consistency, conservativeness or set-drivenness, exemplifying various natural learning restrictions.   Building on previous results from the literature, we provide several maps (depictions of all pairwise relations) of various groups of learning criteria, including a map for monotonicity restrictions and similar criteria and a map for restrictions on data presentation.

This so-called $W$-index allows for naming arbitrary computably enumerable languages, with the drawback that even the membership problem is undecidable. In this paper we use a different system which allows for naming arbitrary decidable languages, namely programs for characteristic functions (called $C$-indices). These indices have the drawback that it is now not decidable whether a given hypothesis is even a legal $C$-index.   In this first analysis of learning with $C$-indices, we give a structured account of the learning power of various restrictions employing $C$-indices, also when compared with $W$-indices. We establish a hierarchy of learning power depending on whether $C$-indices are required (a) on all outputs; (b) only on outputs relevant for the class to be learned and (c) only in the limit as final, correct hypotheses. Furthermore, all these settings are weaker than learning with $W$-indices (even when restricted to classes of computable languages). We analyze all these questions also in relation to the mode of data presentation.   Finally, we also ask about the relation of semantic versus syntactic convergence and derive the map of pairwise relations for these two kinds of convergence coupled with various forms of data presentation."

Besides being a natural requirement for a learning task, this restriction deserves special attention as it is a specialization of various important learning paradigms. In particular, with the help of witness-based learning, explanatory learners are shown to be equally powerful under these seemingly incomparable paradigms. Nonetheless, until now, witness-based learners have only been studied sparsely.   In this work, we conduct a thorough study of these learners both when requiring syntactic and semantic convergence and obtain normal forms thereof. In the former setting, we extend known results such that they include witness-based learning and generalize these to hold for a variety of learners. Transitioning to behaviourally correct learning, we also provide normal forms for semantically witness-based learners. Most notably, we show that set-driven globally semantically witness-based learners are equally powerful as their Gold-style semantically conservative counterpart. Such results are key to understanding the, yet undiscovered, mutual relation between various important learning paradigms when learning behaviourally correctly."

As such, monotonic restrictions always enjoyed particular attention as, although being a natural requirement, monotonic learners show significantly diverse behaviour when studied in different settings. A recent study thoroughly analysed the learning capabilities of strongly monotone learners imposed with memory restrictions and various additional requirements. The unveiled differences between explanatory and behaviourally correct such learners motivate our studies of monotone learners dealing with the same restrictions.   We reveal differences and similarities between monotone learners and their strongly monotone counterpart when studied with various additional restrictions. In particular, we show that explanatory monotone learners, although known to be strictly stronger, do (almost) preserve the pairwise relation as seen in strongly monotone learning. Contrasting this similarity, we find substantial differences when studying behaviourally correct monotone learners. Most notably, we show that monotone learners, as opposed to their strongly monotone counterpart, do heavily rely on the order the information is given in, an unusual result for behaviourally correct learners."

In particular, the connective constant of such a graph is an algebraic number.   If $G$ is deterministically edge labelled, that is, every (directed) edge carries a label such that any two edges starting at the same vertex have different labels, then the set of all words which can be read along the edges of self-avoiding walks starting at $o$ forms a language denoted by $L_{\mathrm{SAW},o}$. Assume that the group of label-preserving graph automorphisms acts quasi-transitively. We show that $L_{\mathrm{SAW},o}$ is a $k$-multiple context-free language if and only if the size of all ends of $G$ is at most $2k$.

The LTL task specification is converted to a limit deterministic generalized B\""uchi automaton (LDGBA) with several accepting sets to maintain dense rewards during learning. The novelty of applying LDGBA is to construct an embedded LDGBA (E-LDGBA) by designing a synchronous tracking-frontier function, which enables the record of non-visited accepting sets without increasing dimensional and computational complexity. With appropriate dependent reward and discount functions, rigorous analysis shows that any method that optimizes the expected discount return of the RL-based approach is guaranteed to find the optimal policy that maximizes the satisfaction probability of the LTL specifications. A model-free RL-based motion planning strategy is developed to generate the optimal policy in this paper. The effectiveness of the RL-based control synthesis is demonstrated via simulation and experimental results."

Formal specification languages, such as Signal Temporal Logic (STL), are used to mathematically express CPS requirements and thus render the simulation activity more systematic and principled. We propose a novel method for adaptive generation of tests with specification coverage for STL. To achieve this goal, we devise cooperative reachability games that we combine with numerical optimization to create tests that explore the system in a way that exercise various parts of the specification. To the best of our knowledge our approach is the first adaptive testing approach that can be applied directly to MATLAB\texttrademark\; Simulink/Stateflow models. We implemented our approach in a prototype tool and evaluated it on several illustrating examples and a case study from the avionics domain, demonstrating the effectiveness of adaptive testing to (1) incrementally build a test case that reaches a test objective, (2) generate a test suite that increases the specification coverage, and (3) infer what part of the specification is actually implemented."

Such properties address aspects such as costs and rewards, quality measures, resource consumption, distance metrics, etc.   Existing solutions for problems in quantitative analysis face two challenges, namely lack of generalizability and separation-of-techniques. Lack of generalizability refers to the issue that solution approaches are specialized to cost model. Different cost models deploy such disparate algorithms that there is no transfer of knowledge from one cost model to another. Separation-of-techniques refers to the inherent dichotomy in solving problems in quantitative analysis. Most algorithms comprise of a structural phase which reasons about the structure of the quantitative system(s) using techniques from automata or graphs, and a numerical phase, which reasons about the quantitative dimension/cost model using numerical methods. The techniques used in both phases are so unlike each other that they are difficult to combine, thereby impacting scalability.   This thesis contributes to a novel framework that addresses these challenges. The introduced framework, called comparator automata or comparators in short, builds on automata-theoretic foundations to generalize across a variety of cost models. Comparators enable automata-based methods in the numerical phase, hence eradicating the dependence on numerical methods. In doing so, comparators are able to integrate the structural and numerical phases. On the theoretical front, we demonstrate that these have the advantage of generalizable results, and yield complexity-theoretic improvements over a range of problems in quantitative analysis. On the empirical front, we demonstrate that comparator-based solutions render more efficient, scalable, and robust performance, and are able to integrate quantitative with qualitative objectives."

These case identifiers are used to correlate events, and the resulting discovered Petri net aims to describe the life-cycle of individual cases. In reality, there is not one possible case notion, but multiple intertwined case notions. For example, events may refer to mixtures of orders, items, packages, customers, and products. A package may refer to multiple items, multiple products, one order, and one customer. Therefore, we need to assume that each event refers to a collection of objects, each having a type (instead of a single case identifier). Such object-centric event logs are closer to data in real-life information systems. From an object-centric event log, we want to discover an object-centric Petri net with places that correspond to object types and transitions that may consume and produce collections of objects of different types. Object-centric Petri nets visualize the complex relationships among objects from different types. This paper discusses a novel process discovery approach implemented in PM4Py. As will be demonstrated, it is indeed feasible to discover holistic process models that can be used to drill-down into specific viewpoints if needed."

Modern language models used for QA have surpassed the human-performance in several essential tasks; however, these models require large amounts of human-generated training data which are costly and time-consuming to create. This paper studies augmenting human-made datasets with synthetic data as a way of surmounting this problem. A state-of-the-art model based on deep transformers is used to inspect the impact of using synthetic answerable and unanswerable questions to complement a well-known human-made dataset. The results indicate a tangible improvement in the performance of the language model (measured in terms of F1 and EM scores) trained on the mixed dataset. Specifically, unanswerable question-answers prove more effective in boosting the model: the F1 score gain from adding to the original dataset the answerable, unanswerable, and combined question-answers were 1.3%, 5.0%, and 6.7%, respectively.

A deceptive defender can allocate decoys, in addition to defense actions, to create disinformation for the attacker. Thus, we focus on the problem of jointly synthesizing a decoy placement strategy and a deceptive defense strategy that maximally exploits the incomplete information the attacker about the decoy locations. We introduce a model of hypergames on graphs with temporal logic objectives to capture such adversarial interactions with asymmetric information. Using the hypergame model, we analyze the effectiveness of a given decoy placement, quantified by the set of deceptive winning states where the defender can prevent the attacker from satisfying the attack objective given its incomplete information about decoy locations. Then, we investigate how to place decoys to maximize the defender's deceptive winning region. Considering the large search space for all possible decoy allocation strategies, we incorporate the idea of compositional synthesis from formal methods and show that the objective function in the class of decoy allocation problem is monotone and non-decreasing. We derive the sufficient conditions under which the objective function for the decoy allocation problem is submodular, or supermodular, respectively. We show a sub-optimal allocation can be efficiently computed by iteratively composing the solutions of hypergames with a subset of decoys and the solution of a hypergame given a single decoy. We use a running example to illustrate the proposed method."

New algorithms and characterizations of store languages are obtained, such as the result that any nondeterministic pushdown automaton augmented with reversal-bounded counters, where the pushdown can ""flip"" its contents up to a bounded number of times, can be accepted by a machine with only reversal-bounded counters. Then, connections are made between store languages and several model checking and reachability problems, such as accepting the set of all predecessor and successor configurations from a given set of configurations, and determining whether there are at least one, or infinitely many, common configurations between accepting computations of two machines. These are explored for a variety of different machine models often containing multiple parallel data stores. Many of the machine models studied can accept the set of predecessor configurations (of a regular set of configurations), the set of successor configurations, and the set of common configurations between two machines, with a machine model that is simpler than itself, with a decidable emptiness, infiniteness, and disjointness property. Store languages are key to showing these properties."

Furthermore, we give for these subsequences a criterion to decide whether the densities exist, in which case they are also computable.   In particular in the prime case these densities are all rational. We also deduce from a recent result of the third author and Lema\'nczyk that all subshifts generated by automatic sequences are orthogonal to any bounded multiplicative aperiodic function."

The weight of a labeling is the semiring-product of the weights assigned to the nodes, and the weight of the graph is the semiring-sum of the weights of labelings. We show that we can model interesting algorithmic questions using this formalism - like computing the clique number of a graph or computing the permanent of a matrix. The evaluation problem is, given a weighted tiling system and a graph, to compute the weight of the graph. We study the complexity of the evaluation problem and give tight upper and lower bounds for several commutative semirings.

Such systems occur naturally in practice (e.g., in the form of distributed protocols where the amount of processes is often unknown at design time and the protocol must work regardless of the number of processes). In this paper, we present a novel learning based approach to the synthesis of reactive controllers for parameterized systems from safety specifications. We use the framework of regular model checking to model the synthesis problem as an infinite-duration two-player game and show how one can utilize Angluin's well-known L* algorithm to learn correct-by-design controllers. This approach results in a synthesis procedure that is conceptually simpler than existing synthesis methods with a completeness guarantee, whenever a winning strategy can be expressed by a regular set. We have implemented our algorithm in a tool called L*-PSynth and have demonstrated its performance on a range of benchmarks, including robotic motion planning and distributed protocols. Despite the simplicity of L*-PSynth it competes well against (and in many cases even outperforms) the state-of-the-art tools for synthesizing parameterized systems."

Reachability for UTA is undecidable in general. Various subclasses with decidable reachability have been studied. A generic approach to UTA reachability consists of two phases: first, a static analysis of the automaton is performed to compute a set of clock constraints at each state; in the second phase, reachable sets of configurations, called zones, are enumerated. In this work, we improve the algorithm for the static analysis. Compared to the existing algorithm, our method computes smaller sets of constraints and guarantees termination for more UTA, making reachability faster and more effective. As the main application, we get an alternate proof of decidability and a more efficient algorithm for timed automata with bounded subtraction, a class of UTA widely used for modelling scheduling problems. We have implemented our procedure in the tool TChecker and conducted experiments that validate the benefits of our approach."

We further improve the understanding and utility of decisiveness in two ways. First, we provide a general criterion for proving decisiveness of general STSs. This criterion, which is very natural but whose proof is rather technical, (strictly) generalizes all known criteria from the literature. Second, we focus on stochastic hybrid systems (SHSs), a stochastic extension of hybrid systems. We establish the decisiveness of a large class of SHSs and, under a few classical hypotheses from mathematical logic, we show how to decide reachability problems in this class, even though they are undecidable for general SHSs.

Indeed, it provides an algorithm to extract a (stochastic) formal language from any recurrent neural network trained for language modelling. In detail, the algorithm uses the already trained network as an oracle -- and thus does not require the access to the inner representation of the black-box -- and applies a spectral approach to infer a weighted automaton.   As weighted automata compute linear functions, they are computationally more efficient than neural networks and thus the nature of the approach is the one of knowledge distillation. We detail experiments on 62 data sets (both synthetic and from real-world applications) that allow an in-depth study of the abilities of the proposed algorithm. The results show the WA we extract are good approximations of the RNN, validating the approach. Moreover, we show how the process provides interesting insights toward the behavior of RNN learned on data, enlarging the scope of this work to the one of explainability of deep learning models."

Specification-driven trace-checking tools for CPS usually provide users with a specification language to express the requirements of interest, and an automatic procedure to check whether these requirements hold on the execution traces of a CPS. Although there exist several specification languages for CPS, they are often not sufficiently expressive to allow the specification of complex CPS properties related to the software and the physical components and their interactions.   In this paper, we propose (i) the Hybrid Logic of Signals (HLS), a logic-based language that allows the specification of complex CPS requirements, and (ii) ThEodorE, an efficient SMT-based trace-checking procedure. This procedure reduces the problem of checking a CPS requirement over an execution trace, to checking the satisfiability of an SMT formula.   We evaluated our contributions by using a representative industrial case study in the satellite domain. We assessed the expressiveness of HLS by considering 212 requirements of our case study. HLS could express all the 212 requirements. We also assessed the applicability of ThEodorE by running the trace-checking procedure for 747 trace-requirement combinations. ThEodorE was able to produce a verdict in 74.5% of the cases. Finally, we compared HLS and ThEodorE with other specification languages and trace-checking tools from the literature. Our results show that, from a practical standpoint, our approach offers a better trade-off between expressiveness and performance."

We also compare pebble-depth to other depth notions based on finite-state transducers, pushdown compressors and the Lempel-Ziv $78$ compression algorithm. We first demonstrate how there exists a normal pebble-deep sequence even though there is no normal finite-state-deep sequence.

This largest solution is commonly called quotient. Across domains, the meanings of the binary operation and the preorder are quite different, yet the syntax for computing the largest solution is remarkably similar. This paper is about finding a common framework to reason about quotients. We only assume we operate on a preorder endowed with an abstract monotonic multiplication and an involution. We provide a condition, called admissibility, which guarantees the existence of the quotient, and which yields its closed form. We call preordered heaps those structures satisfying the admissibility condition. We show that many existing theories in computer science are preordered heaps, and we are thus able to derive a quotient for them, subsuming existing solutions when available in the literature. We introduce the concept of sieved heaps to deal with structures which are given over multiple domains of definition. We show that sieved heaps also have well-defined quotients."

For deterministic automata on infinite words, no canonical minimal automaton exists, and a language may have different minimal deterministic B\""uchi (DBW) or co-B\""uchi (DCW) automata. In recent years, researchers have studied {\em good-for-games\/} (GFG) automata -- nondeterministic automata that can resolve their nondeterministic choices in a way that only depends on the past. Several applications of automata in formal methods, most notably synthesis, that are traditionally based on deterministic automata, can instead be based on GFG automata. The {\em minimization\/} problem for DBW and DCW is NP-complete, and it stays NP-complete for GFG B\""uchi and co-B\""uchi automata. On the other hand, minimization of GFG co-B\""uchi automata with {\em transition-based\/} acceptance (GFG-tNCWs) can be solved in polynomial time. In these automata, acceptance is defined by a set $\alpha$ of transitions, and a run is accepting if it traverses transitions in $\alpha$ only finitely often. This raises the question of canonicity of minimal deterministic and GFG automata with transition-based acceptance. In this paper we study this problem. We start with GFG-tNCWs and show that the safe components (that is, these obtained by restricting the transitions to these not in $\alpha$) of all minimal GFG-tNCWs are isomorphic, and that by saturating the automaton with transitions in $\alpha$ we get isomorphism among all minimal GFG-tNCWs. Thus, a canonical form for minimal GFG-tNCWs can be obtained in polynomial time. We continue to DCWs with transition-based acceptance (tDCWs), and their dual tDBWs. We show that here, while no canonical form for minimal automata exists, restricting attention to the safe components is useful, and implies that the only minimal tDCWs that have no canonical form are these for which the transition to the GFG model results in strictly smaller automaton, which do have a canonical minimal form."

To this end, safety engineers rely during the development phase on architectural solutions, called safety patterns, such as safety monitors, voters, and watchdogs. The goal of these patterns is to control (identified) faults that can trigger hazards. Safety patterns can control such faults by e.g., increasing the redundancy of the system. Currently, the reasoning of which pattern to use at which part of the target system to control which hazard is documented mostly in textual form or by means of models, such as GSN-models, with limited support for automation. This paper proposes the use of logic programming engines for the automated reasoning about system safety. We propose a domain-specific language for embedded system safety and specify as disjunctive logic programs reasoning principles used by safety engineers to deploy safety patterns, e.g., when to use safety monitors, or watchdogs. Our machinery enables two types of automated safety reasoning: (1) identification of which hazards can be controlled and which ones cannot be controlled by the existing safety patterns; and (2) automated recommendation of which patterns could be used at which place of the system to control potential hazards. Finally, we apply our machinery to two examples taken from the automotive domain: an adaptive cruise control system and a battery management system."

Thus far, generalisation to infinite state systems with inputs/outputs that carry data parameters has been challenging. Existing model learning tools for infinite state systems face scalability problems and can only be applied to restricted classes of systems (register automata with equality/inequality). In this article, we show how we can boost the performance of model learning techniques by extracting the constraints on input and output parameters from a run, and making this grey-box information available to the learner. More specifically, we provide new implementations of the tree oracle and equivalence oracle from RALib, which use the derived constraints. We extract the constraints from runs of Python programs using an existing tainting library for Python, and compare our grey-box version of RALib with the existing black-box version on several benchmarks, including some data structures from Python's standard library. Our proof-of-principle implementation results in almost two orders of magnitude improvement in terms of numbers of inputs sent to the software system. Our approach, which can be generalised to richer model classes, also enables RALib to learn models that are out of reach of black-box techniques, such as combination locks."

Frequently, this type of automata has been found through either an exhaustive search or a meticulous construction of the evolution rule. In this study, the specification of cellular automata with complex behaviors was obtained by utilizing randomly generated specimens. In particular, it proposed that a cellular automaton of $n$ states should be specified at random and then extended to another automaton with a higher number of states so that the original automaton operates as a periodic background where the additional states serve to define the gliders. Moreover, this study presented an explanation of this method. Furthermore, the random way of defining complex cellular automata was studied by using mean-field approximations for various states and local entropy measures. This specification was refined with a genetic algorithm to obtain specimens with a higher degree of complexity. With this methodology, it was possible to generate complex automata with hundreds of states, demonstrating that randomly defined local interactions with multiple states can construct complexity."

A significant amount of previous research has been conducted proposing instances of complex cellular automata; however, most of the proposed methods are based on a careful search or a meticulous construction of evolution rules.   This paper presents the emergence of complex behaviors based on reversible cellular automata. In particular, this paper shows that reversible cellular automata represent an adequate framework to obtain complex behaviors adding only new random states.   Experimental results show that complexity can be obtained from reversible cellular automata appending a proportion of about two times more states at random than the original number of states in the reversible automaton. Thus, it is possible to obtain complex cellular automata with dozens of states. Complexity appears to be commonly obtained from reversible cellular automata, and using other operations such as permutations of states or row and column permutations in the evolution rule. The relevance of this paper is to present that reversibility can be a useful structure to implement complex behaviors in cellular automata."

BMC for LTL is reduced to SAT solving, because LTL describes a property via inspecting individual traces. HyperLTL allows explicit and simultaneous quantification over traces and describes properties that involves multiple traces and, hence, our BMC approach naturally reduces to QBF solving.

The algorithm amounts to a procedure that transforms a grammar of order n to a grammar of order n-1, preserving nonemptiness, and increasing the size only exponentially. After repeating the procedure n times, we obtain a grammar of order 0, whose nonemptiness can be easily checked. Since the size grows exponentially at each step, the overall complexity is n-EXPTIME, which is known to be optimal. More precisely, the transformation (and hence the whole algorithm) is linear in the size of the grammar, assuming that the arity of employed nonterminals is bounded by a constant. The same algorithm allows to check whether an infinite tree generated by a higher-order recursion scheme is accepted by an alternating safety (or reachability) automaton, because this question can be reduced to the nonemptiness problem by taking a product of the recursion scheme with the automaton.   A proof of correctness of the algorithm is formalised in the proof assistant Coq. Our transformation is motivated by a similar transformation of Asada and Kobayashi (2020) changing a word grammar of order n to a tree grammar of order n-1. The step-by-step approach can be opposed to previous algorithms solving the nonemptiness problem ""in one step"", being compulsorily more complicated."

The notion of test for communicating systems cannot simply be borrowed from existing proposals. Therefore, we formalize a notion of suitable distributed tests for a given choreography and devise an algorithm that generates tests as projections of global views. Our algorithm abstracts away from the actual projection operation, for which we only set basic requirements. The algorithm can be instantiated by reusing existing projection operations (designed to generate local implementations of global models) as they satisfy our requirements. Finally, we show the correctness of the approach and validate our methodology via an illustrative example."
2020-09-17 00:47:49+00:00,2020-09-17 00:47:49+00:00,"Development of software is an iterative process. Graphical tools to represent the relevant entities and processes can be helpful. In particular, automata capture well the intended execution flow of applications, and are thus behind many formal approaches, namely behavioral types.   Typestate-oriented programming allow us to model and validate the intended protocol of applications, not only providing a top-down approach to the development of software, but also coping well with compositional development. Moreover, it provides important static guarantees like protocol fidelity and some forms of progress.   Mungo is a front-end tool for Java that associates a typestate describing the valid orders of method calls to each class, and statically checks that the code of all classes follows the prescribed order of method calls.   To assist programming with Mungo, as typestates are textual descriptions that are terms of an elaborate grammar, we developed a tool that bidirectionally converts typestates into an adequate form of automata, providing on one direction a visualization of the underlying protocol specified by the typestate, and on the reverse direction a way to get a syntactically correct typestate from the more intuitive automata representation."

Much recent progress towards this goal has been made through controller synthesis from temporal logic specifications. Existing approaches, however, have been limited to relatively short and simple specifications. Furthermore, existing methods either consider some prior discretization of the state-space, deal only with a convex fragment of temporal logic, or are not provably complete. We propose a scalable, provably complete algorithm that synthesizes continuous trajectories to satisfy non-convex \gls*{rtl} specifications. We separate discrete task planning and continuous motion planning on-the-fly and harness highly efficient boolean satisfiability (SAT) and \gls*{lp} solvers to find dynamically feasible trajectories that satisfy non-convex \gls*{rtl} specifications for high dimensional systems. The proposed design algorithms are proven sound and complete, and simulation results demonstrate our approach's scalability."

Examined connections in this master's thesis is threefold: the extractability of finite state machines from recurrent neural networks, learnability aspects and computationnal links. With respect to the former, the long-standing clustering hypothesis of RNN hidden state space when trained to recognize regular languages was explored, and new insights into this hypothesis through the lens of recent advances of the generalization theory of Deep Learning are provided. As for learnability, an extension of the active learning framework better suited to the problem of approximating RNNs with FSMs is proposed, with the aim of better formalizing the problem of RNN approximation by FSMs. Theoretical analysis of two possible scenarions in this framework were performed. With regard to computability, new computational results on the distance and the equivalence problem between RNNs trained as language models and different types of weighted finite state machines were given."

In previously published work by Jordon and Moser, notions of finite-state-depth and pushdown-depth were examined and compared. These were based on finite-state transducers and information lossless pushdown compressors respectively. Unfortunately a full separation between the two notions was not established. This paper introduces a new formulation of pushdown-depth based on restricting how fast a pushdown compressor's stack can grow. This improved formulation allows us to do a full comparison by demonstrating the existence of sequences with high finite-state-depth and low pushdown-depth, and vice-versa. A new notion based on the Lempel-Ziv `78 algorithm is also introduced. Its difference from finite-state-depth is shown by demonstrating the existence of a Lempel-Ziv deep sequence that is not finite-state deep and vice versa. Lempel-Ziv-depth's difference from pushdown-depth is shown by building sequences that have a pushdown-depth of roughly 1/2 but low Lempel-Ziv depth, and a sequence with high Lempel-Ziv depth but low pushdown-depth. Properties of all three notions are also discussed and proved."

Since 2013, it is still unknown if $\mathrm{PPL}_{\mathbf{u}}(n)$ is unbounded for every aperiodic infinite word $\mathbf{u}$, even though this has been proven for almost all aperiodic words. At the same time, the only well-known nontrivial infinite word for which the function $\mathrm{PPL}_{\mathbf{u}}(n)$ has been precisely computed is the Thue-Morse word $\mathbf{t}$. This word is $2$-automatic and, predictably, its function $\mathrm{PPL}_{\mathbf{t}}(n)$ is $2$-regular, but is this the case for all automatic words?   In this paper, we prove that this function is $k$-regular for every $k$-automatic word containing only a finite number of palindromes. For two such words, namely the paperfolding word and the Rudin-Shapiro word, we derive a formula for this function. Our computational experiments suggest that generally this is not true: for the period-doubling word, the prefix palindromic length does not look $2$-regular, and for the Fibonacci word, it does not look Fibonacci-regular. If proven, these results would give rare (if not first) examples of a natural function of an automatic word which is not regular."

For confidentiality reasons, this copy may be only a partial replica containing only parts of the (global) document which are of demonstrated interest for the considered co-author. Note that some parts may be a demonstrated interest over a co-author; they will therefore be accessible concurrently. When it's synchronization time (e.g. at the end of an asynchronous editing phase of the process), we want to merge all contributions of all authors in a single document. Due to the asynchronism of edition and to the potential existence of the document parts offering concurrent access, conflicts may arise and make partial replicas unmergeable in their entirety: they are inconsistent, meaning that they contain conflictual parts. The purpose of this paper is to propose a merging approach said by consensus of such partial replicas using tree automata. Specifically, from the partial replicas updates, we build a tree automaton that accepts exactly the consensus documents. These documents are the maximum prefixes containing no conflict of partial replicas merged."

The advantage concerned in this paper attempts to address the need for memory resources during the simulation of systems by cellular-DEVS. This improvement of performance is based on the usage of the property closure under coupling in the DEVS formalism. With this property and taking account of the iterative behavior of each cellular-DEVS atomic model, we provide simulation of many models simultaneously. The method starts with the specification of the cellular-DEVS coupled model which is then converted into its equivalent DEVS atomic model. Thus, the goal of this conversion is to transform large quantities of atomic models coupled together, which require huge computational resources, into one DEVS atomic model. A case study is presented at the end of the work on modeling and simulation of forest fire propagation using DEVS and cellular-DEVS. A specification by cellular-DEVS of the forest fire model and its non-modular equivalent DEVS atomic model are presented. Finally, a comparison between both methods is presented in term of consumption of resources."

In this paper, we study projections of languages recognized by various two-dimensional automaton classes. We show that both the row and column projections of languages recognized by (four-way) two-dimensional automata are exactly context-sensitive. We also show that the column projections of languages recognized by unary three-way two-dimensional automata can be recognized using nondeterministic logspace. Finally, we study the state complexity of projection languages for two-way two-dimensional automata, focusing on the language operations of union and diagonal concatenation."

While a standard (four-way) two-dimensional automaton can move its input head in four directions, restricted two-dimensional automata are only permitted to move their input heads in three or two directions; these models are called three-way and two-way two-dimensional automata, respectively.   In two dimensions, we may extend the notion of concatenation in multiple ways, depending on the words to be concatenated. We may row-concatenate (resp., column-concatenate) a pair of two-dimensional words when they have the same number of columns (resp., rows). In addition, the diagonal concatenation operation combines two words at their lower-right and upper-left corners, and is not dimension-dependent.   In this paper, we investigate closure properties of restricted models of two-dimensional automata under various concatenation operations. We give non-closure results for two-way two-dimensional automata under row and column concatenation in both the deterministic and nondeterministic cases. We further give positive closure results for the same concatenation operations on unary nondeterministic two-way two-dimensional automata. Finally, we study closure properties of diagonal concatenation on both two- and three-way two-dimensional automata."

The data can be time-sensitive and require to be transmitted to a data processing center. However, planning the trajectory of a collaborative UAV swarm depends on multi-fold constraints, such as data collection requirements, UAV maneuvering capacity, and budget limitation. Since a UAV may fail or be compromised, it is important to provide necessary resilience to such contingencies, thus ensuring data security. It is important to provide the UAVs with efficient spatio-temporal trajectories so that they can efficiently cover necessary data sources. In this work, we present Synth4UAV, a formal approach for automated synthesis of efficient trajectories for a UAV swarm by logically modeling the aerial space and data point topology, UAV moves, and associated constraints in terms of the turning and climbing angle, fuel usage, data collection point coverage, data freshness, and resiliency properties. We use efficient, logical formulas to encode and solve the complex model. The solution to the model provides the routing and maneuvering plan for each UAV, including the time to visit the points on the paths and corresponding fuel usage such that the necessary data points are visited while satisfying the resiliency requirements. We evaluate the proposed trajectory synthesizer, and the results show that the relationship among different parameters follow the requirements while the tool scales well with the problem size."

Furthermore, emphasis is placed on the design of machines and this article presents a novel design recipe for deterministic finite-state machines. In support of the design process, the visualization tool allows for each state to be associated with an invariant predicate. During machine execution, the visualization tool indicates if the proposed invariant holds or does not hold after each transition. In this manner, students can validate and debug their machines before attempting to prove partial correctness or submitting for grading. In addition, any machine edited with the visualization tool can be rendered as executable code. The interface of the visualization tool along with extended examples of its use are presented."

It is central in data compression, as well as in efficient query algorithms for sequence data, such as webpages, genomic and other biological sequences, or indeed any textual data. The BWT lends itself well to compression because its number of equal-letter-runs (usually referred to as $r$) is often considerably lower than that of the original string; in particular, it is well suited for strings with many repeated factors. In fact, much attention has been paid to the $r$ parameter as measure of repetitiveness, especially to evaluate the performance in terms of both space and time of compressed indexing data structures.   In this paper, we investigate $\rho(v)$, the ratio of $r$ and of the number of runs of the BWT of the reverse of $v$. Kempa and Kociumaka [FOCS 2020] gave the first non-trivial upper bound as $\rho(v) = O(\log^2(n))$, for any string $v$ of length $n$. However, nothing is known about the tightness of this upper bound. We present infinite families of binary strings for which $\rho(v) = \Theta(\log n)$ holds, thus giving the first non-trivial lower bound on $\rho(n)$, the maximum over all strings of length $n$.   Our results suggest that $r$ is not an ideal measure of the repetitiveness of the string, since the number of repeated factors is invariant between the string and its reverse. We believe that there is a more intricate relationship between the number of runs of the BWT and the string's combinatorial properties."

The notion of an abelian closure gives a characterization of Sturmian words: among binary uniformly recurrent words, Sturmian words are exactly those words for which $\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{x})$ equals the shift orbit closure $\Omega(\mathbf{x})$.

The specification is often described in temporal logic. Some types of specifications can be converted into deterministic finite automata (DFA) as an intermediate step in synthesis, thus benefiting from the fact that DFAs can be fully minimized in polynomial time. In this work we investigate DFA-minimization algorithms in the context of temporal synthesis. In particular, we compare between the Hopcroft and Brzozowski minimization algorithms, adapting them to start from temporal-logic formulas and integrating them into an existing temporal synthesis framework. While earlier studies comparing the two algorithms for randomly-generated automata concluded that neither algorithm dominates, our results suggest that in the context of temporal-synthesis, Hopcroft's algorithm is the best choice. Analyzing the results, we observe that the reason for the poor performance of Brzozowski's algorithm is a discrepancy between theory and practice. This algorithm first constructs a DFA for the reverse language of the specification and then performs a series of operations to transform it into a minimal DFA for the specification itself. In theory, the DFA for the reverse language can be exponentially smaller, which would potentially make this algorithm more efficient than directly constructing the DFA for the original specification. In practice, however, we find that the reverse DFA is often of comparable size or even larger, which cancels the advantage that this approach could have."

In this context, our contribution is twofold: (I) We construct abstractions which model the impact of occasional high disturbance spikes on the system via so called disturbance edges.

Limited to these operations, we construct RNA automata of increasing complexity; from the Finite Automaton (RNA-FA) to the Turing Machine equivalent 2-stack PDA (RNA-2PDA) and the universal RNA-UPDA. For each automaton we show how the enzymatic reactions match the logical operations of the RNA automaton, and describe how biological exploration of the corresponding evolutionary space is facilitated by the efficient arrangement of RNA polymers into a computational structure. A critical theme of the Ansatz is the self-reference in RNA automata configurations which exploits the program-data duality but results in undecidable computation. We describe how undecidable computation is exemplified in the self-referential Liar paradox that places a boundary on a logical system, and by construction, any RNA automata. We argue that an expansion of the evolutionary space for RNA-2PDA automata can be interpreted as a hierarchical resolution of the undecidable computation by a meta-system (akin to Turing's oracle), in a continual process analogous to Turing's ordinal logics and Post's extensible recursively generated logics. On this basis, we put forward the hypothesis that the resolution of undecidable configurations in RNA-world automata represents a mechanism for novelty generation in the evolutionary space, and propose avenues for future investigation of biological automata."

The depth of such a series is the largest $d\geq 1$ for which $a_2=\dots=a_d=0$. Only a handful of power series of finite order are explicitly known through a formula for their coefficients. We argue in this paper that it is advantageous to describe such series in closed computational form through automata, based on effective versions of proofs of Christol's theorem identifying algebraic and automatic series. Up to conjugation, there are only finitely many series $\sigma$ of order $2^n$ with fixed break sequence (i.e. the sequence of depths of $\sigma^{\circ 2^i}$). Starting from Witt vector or Carlitz module constructions, we give an explicit automaton-theoretic description of: (a) representatives up to conjugation for all series of order 4 with break sequence (1,m) for m<10; (b) representatives up to conjugation for all series of order 8 with minimal break sequence (1,3,11); and (c) an embedding of the Klein four-group into the Nottingham group at 2. We study the complexity of the new examples from the algebro-geometric properties of the equations they satisfy. For this, we generalise the theory of sparseness of power series to a four-step hierarchy of complexity, for which we give both Galois-theoretic and combinatorial descriptions. We identify where our different series fit into this hierarchy. We construct sparse representatives for the conjugacy class of elements of order two and depth $2^\mu \pm 1$ $(\mu \geq 1)$. Series with small state complexity can end up high in the hierarchy. This is true, for example, for a new automaton we found, representing a series of order 4 with 5 states, the minimal possible number for such a series."

However, the execution of safety engineering practices and processes have been challenged by an increasing complexity of modern safety-critical systems. This attribute has become more critical for autonomous systems that involve artificial intelligence (AI) and data-driven techniques along with the complex interactions of the physical world and digital computing platforms. In this position paper, we highlight some challenges of applying current safety processes to modern autonomous systems. Then, we introduce the concept of SafetyOps - a set of practices, which combines DevOps, TestOps, DataOps, and MLOps to provide an efficient, continuous and traceable system safety lifecycle. We believe that SafetyOps can play a significant role in scalable integration and adaptation of safety engineering into various industries relying on AI and data."

The idea is that, while progress measure based techniques typically focus on one of the two players, little information is gathered on the other player during the solution process. Adding quasi dominions provides additional information on this player that can be leveraged to accelerate convergence to a progress measure. To accommodate quasi dominions, however, a non trivial refinement of the approach is necessary. In particular, we need to introduce a novel notion of measure and a new approach to prove correctness of the resulting solution technique."

The language allows to describe infinite sets of systems whose coordination between components share the same pattern, using inductive definitions similar to the ones used to describe algebraic data types or recursive data structures. Further, we give a verification method for the parametric systems described in this language, relying on the automatic synthesis of structural invariants that enable proving general safety properties (mutual exclusion, absence of deadlocks). The invariants are defined using the WSkS fragment of the monadic second order logic, known to be decidable by a classical automata-logic connection. This reduces the safety verification problem to checking satisfiability of a WSkS formula."

Vehicle dynamics is characterized by pre-computed functions for accelerating and braking to a given speed. Environment is modeled by a function of time giving the free distance ahead of the controlled vehicle under the assumption that the obstacles are either fixed or are moving in the same direction. The main result is a control policy enforcing the vehicle's speed so as to avoid collision and efficiently use the free distance ahead, provided some initial safety condition holds. The studied principle is applied to the design of two discrete controllers, one synchronous and another asynchronous. We show that both controllers are safe by construction. Furthermore, we show that their efficiency strictly increases for decreasing granularity of discretization. We present implementations of the two controllers, their experimental evaluation in the Carla autonomous driving simulator and investigate various performance issues."
2020-08-08 13:13:37+00:00,2020-08-17 17:30:51+00:00,"The locality of words is a relatively young structural complexity measure, introduced by Day et al. in 2017 in order to define classes of patterns with variables which can be matched in polynomial time. The main tool used to compute the locality of a word is called marking sequence: an ordering of the distinct letters occurring in the respective order. Once a marking sequence is defined, the letters of the word are marked in steps: in the ith marking step, all occurrences of the ith letter of the marking sequence are marked. As such, after each marking step, the word can be seen as a sequence of blocks of marked letters separated by blocks of non-marked letters. By keeping track of the evolution of the marked blocks of the word through the marking defined by a marking sequence, one defines the blocksequence of the respective marking sequence. We first show that the words sharing the same blocksequence are only loosely connected, so we consider the stronger notion of extended blocksequence, which stores additional information on the form of each single marked block. In this context, we present a series of combinatorial results for words sharing the extended blocksequence."

We show that many of the algorithmic properties of automatic groups are preserved (quadratic time word problem), prove various closure properties, and show that the class is quite large; for example it includes all virtually polycyclic groups. We then generalise to groups which have normal form language in the class $\mathcal C$ and multiplication by generators computable in polynomial time on a (standard) Turing machine. Of particular interest is when $\mathcal C= \mathrm{REG}$ (the class of regular languages).

It refines differential privacy, the current gold standard in data privacy, by allowing explicit prior knowledge in privacy analysis. Through these privacy frameworks, a number of privacy mechanisms have been developed in literature. In practice, privacy mechanisms often need be modified or adjusted to specific applications. Their privacy risks have to be re-evaluated for different circumstances. Moreover, computing devices only approximate continuous noises through floating-point computation, which is discrete in nature. Privacy proofs can thus be complicated and prone to errors. Such tedious tasks can be burdensome to average data curators. In this paper, we propose an automatic verification technique for Pufferfish privacy. We use hidden Markov models to specify and analyze discretized Pufferfish privacy mechanisms. We show that the Pufferfish verification problem in hidden Markov models is NP-hard. Using Satisfiability Modulo Theories solvers, we propose an algorithm to analyze privacy requirements. We implement our algorithm in a prototypical tool called FAIER, and present several case studies. Surprisingly, our case studies show that na\""ive discretization of well-established privacy mechanisms often fail, witnessed by counterexamples generated by FAIER. In discretized \emph{Above Threshold}, we show that it results in absolutely no privacy. Finally, we compare our approach with testing based approach on several case studies, and show that our verification technique can be combined with testing based approach for the purpose of (i) efficiently certifying counterexamples and (ii) obtaining a better lower bound for the privacy budget $\epsilon$."

For the converse, we consider a categorical framework for defining automata and transducers over words, which allows us to relate register updates in SSTs to the semantics of the linear $\lambda$-calculus in a suitable monoidal closed category. To illustrate the relevance of monoidal closure to automata theory, we also leverage this notion to give abstract generalizations of the arguments showing that copyless SSTs may be determinized and that the composition of two regular functions may be implemented by a copyless SST. Our main result is then generalized from strings to trees using a similar approach. In doing so, we exhibit a connection between a feature of streaming tree transducers and the multiplicative/additive distinction of linear logic.

A word equation relates two words over string variables and constants. Its solution amounts to a function mapping variables to constant strings that equate the left and right hand sides of the equation. While the problem of solving word equations is decidable, the decidability of the problem of solving a word equation with a length constraint (i.e., a constraint relating the lengths of words in the word equation) has remained a long-standing open problem. We focus on the subclass of quadratic word equations, i.e., in which each variable occurs at most twice. We first show that the length abstractions of solutions to quadratic word equations are in general not Presburger-definable. We then describe a class of counter systems with Presburger transition relations which capture the length abstraction of a quadratic word equation with regular constraints. We provide an encoding of the effect of a simple loop of the counter systems in the existential theory of Presburger Arithmetic with divisibility (PAD). Since PAD is decidable (NP-hard and is in NEXP), we obtain a decision procedure for quadratic words equations with length constraints for which the associated counter system is flat (i.e., all nodes belong to at most one cycle). In particular, we show a decidability result (in fact, also an NP algorithm with a PAD oracle) for a recently proposed NP-complete fragment of word equations called regular-oriented word equations, when augmented with length constraints. We extend this decidability result (in fact, with a complexity upper bound of PSPACE with a PAD oracle) in the presence of regular constraints."

In this work we consider multi-dimensional long-run average objectives for VASS and probabilistic VASS. For a counter, the cost of a configuration is the value of the counter; and the long-run average value of a computation for the counter is the long-run average of the costs of the configurations in the computation. The multi-dimensional long-run average problem given a VASS and a threshold value for each counter, asks whether there is a computation such that for each counter the long-run average value for the counter does not exceed the respective threshold. For probabilistic VASS, instead of the existence of a computation, we consider whether the expected long-run average value for each counter does not exceed the respective threshold. Our main results are as follows: we show that the multi-dimensional long-run average problem (a) is NP-complete for integer-valued VASS; (b) is undecidable for natural-valued VASS (i.e., nonnegative counters); and (c) can be solved in polynomial time for probabilistic integer-valued VASS, and probabilistic natural-valued VASS when all computations are non-terminating."

Here, we investigate weighted context-free languages of infinite words, a generalization of $\omega$-context-free languages (Cohen, Gold 1977) and an extension of weighted context-free languages of finite words (Chomsky, Sch\""utzenberger 1963). As in the theory of formal grammars, these weighted context-free languages, or $\omega$-algebraic series, can be represented as solutions of mixed $\omega$-algebraic systems of equations and by weighted $\omega$-pushdown automata.   In our first main result, we show that (mixed) $\omega$-algebraic systems can be transformed into Greibach normal form. We use the Greibach normal form in our second main result to prove that simple $\omega$-reset pushdown automata recognize all $\omega$-algebraic series. Simple $\omega$-reset automata do not use $\epsilon$-transitions and can change the stack only by at most one symbol. These results generalize fundamental properties of context-free languages to weighted context-free languages."
2020-07-17 08:46:10+00:00,2020-07-17 08:46:10+00:00,"In this paper we present a novel model checking approach to finite-time safety verification of black-box continuous-time dynamical systems within the framework of probably approximately correct (PAC) learning. The black-box dynamical systems are the ones, for which no model is given but whose states changing continuously through time within a finite time interval can be observed at some discrete time instants for a given input. The new model checking approach is termed as PAC model checking due to incorporation of learned models with correctness guarantees expressed using the terms error probability and confidence. Based on the error probability and confidence level, our approach provides statistically formal guarantees that the time-evolving trajectories of the black-box dynamical system over finite time horizons fall within the range of the learned model plus a bounded interval, contributing to insights on the reachability of the black-box system and thus on the satisfiability of its safety requirements. The learned model together with the bounded interval is obtained by scenario optimization, which boils down to a linear programming problem. Three examples demonstrate the performance of our approach."

It will also enlighten pre-existing issues that have been running across process algebras as diverse as the calculus of communicating systems, the \(\pi\)-calculus -- also in its distributed version -- or mobile ambients.Our distinction starts by subdividing the notion of process itself in three conceptually separated entities, that we call \emph{Processes}, \emph{Systems} and \emph{Tests}.While the role of what can be observed and the subtleties in the definitions of congruences have been intensively studied, the fact that \emph{not every process can be tested}, and that \emph{the tester should have access to a different set of tools than the programmer} is curiously left out, or at least not often formally discussed.We argue that this blind spot comes from the under-specification of contexts -- environments in which comparisons takes place -- that play multiple distinct roles but supposedly always \enquote{stay the same}.We illustrate our statement with a simple Java example, the \enquote{usual} concurrent languages, but also back it up with \(\lambda\)-calculus and existing implementations of concurrent languages as well."

First, we show that a more general version of the finiteness problem for automaton groups is undecidable. This problem is equivalent to the finiteness problem for left principal ideals in automaton semigroups generated by complete and reversible automata. Then, we look at $\omega$-word (i.e. right infinite words) with a finite orbit. We show that every automaton yielding an $\omega$-word with a finite orbit already yields an ultimately periodic one, which is not periodic in general, however. On the algorithmic side, we observe that it is not possible to decide whether a given periodic $\omega$-word has an infinite orbit and that we cannot check whether a given reversible and complete automaton admits an $\omega$-word with a finite orbit, a reciprocal problem to the finiteness problem for automaton semigroups in the reversible case. Finally, we look at automaton groups generated by reversible but not bi-reversible automata and show that many words have infinite orbits under the action of such automata."

This framework supports true concurrency and provides a non-trivial generalization of the wreath product operation to the trace setting. A novel local wreath product principle has been established. The new framework is crucially used to propose a decomposition result for recognizable trace languages, which is an analogue of the Krohn-Rhodes theorem. We prove this decomposition result in the special case of acyclic architectures and apply it to extend Kamp's theorem to this setting. We also introduce and analyze distributed automata-theoretic operations called local and global cascade products. Finally, we show that aperiodic trace languages can be characterized using global cascade products of localized and distributed two-state reset automata."

We show that the problem is undecidable, even for the instantiation of weighted automata as labelled Markov chains. Moreover, even when it is known that one weighted automaton is big-O of another, the problem of finding or approximating the associated constant is also undecidable.   Our positive results show that the big-O problem is polynomial-time solvable for unambiguous automata, coNP-complete for unlabelled weighted automata (i.e., when the alphabet is a single character) and decidable, subject to Schanuel's conjecture, when the language is bounded (i.e., a subset of $w_1^*\dots w_m^*$ for some finite words $w_1,\dots,w_m$) or when the automaton has finite ambiguity.   On labelled Markov chains, the problem can be restated as a ratio total variation distance, which, instead of finding the maximum difference between the probabilities of any two events, finds the maximum ratio between the probabilities of any two events. The problem is related to $\epsilon$-differential privacy, for which the optimal constant of the big-O notation is exactly $\exp(\epsilon)$."

In an effort to understand its dynamics, and since Generalised Collatz Maps are known to simulate Turing Machines [Conway, 1972], it seems natural to ask what kinds of algorithmic behaviours it embeds. We define a quasi-cellular automaton that exactly simulates the Collatz process on the square grid: on input $x\in\mathbb{N}$, written horizontally in base 2, successive rows give the Collatz sequence of $x$ in base 2. We show that vertical columns simultaneously iterate the map in base 3. This leads to our main result: the Collatz process embeds an algorithm that converts any natural number from base 3 to base 2. We also find that the evolution of our automaton computes the parity of the number of 1s in any ternary input. It follows that predicting about half of the bits of the iterates $T^i(x)$, for $i = O(\log x)$, is in the complexity class NC$^1$ but outside AC$^0$. Finally, we show that in the extension of the Collatz process to numbers with infinite binary expansions ($2$-adic integers) [Lagarias, 1985], our automaton encodes the cyclic Collatz conjecture as a natural reachability problem. These results show that the Collatz process is capable of some simple, but non-trivial, computation in bases 2 and 3, suggesting an algorithmic approach to thinking about existence, prediction and structure of cycles in the Collatz process."

Integer data type occurs naturally in string-manipulating programs, and is frequently used to refer to lengths of, or positions in, strings. Analysis and testing of string-manipulating programs can be formulated as the path feasibility problem: given a symbolic execution path, does there exist an assignment to the inputs that yields a concrete execution that realizes this path? Such a problem can naturally be reformulated as a string constraint solving problem. Although state-of-the-art string constraint solvers usually provide support for both string and integer data types, they mainly resort to heuristics without completeness guarantees. In this paper, we propose a decision procedure for a class of string-manipulating programs which includes not only a wide range of string operations such as concatenation, replaceAll, reverse, and finite transducers, but also those involving the integer data-type such as length, indexof, and substring. To the best of our knowledge, this represents one of the most expressive string constraint languages that is currently known to be decidable. Our decision procedure is based on a variant of cost register automata. We implement the decision procedure, giving rise to a new solver OSTRICH+. We evaluate the performance of OSTRICH+ on a wide range of existing and new benchmarks. The experimental results show that OSTRICH+ is the first string decision procedure capable of tackling finite transducers and integer constraints, whilst its overall performance is comparable with the state-of-the-art string constraint solvers."

Our main result is a generalization of the classical Myhill-Nerode theorem to this symbolic setting. Our generalization requires the use of three relations to capture the additional structure of register automata. Location equivalence $\equiv_l$ captures that symbolic traces end in the same location, transition equivalence $\equiv_t$ captures that they share the same final transition, and a partial equivalence relation $\equiv_r$ captures that symbolic values $v$ and $v'$ are stored in the same register after symbolic traces $w$ and $w'$, respectively. A symbolic language is defined to be regular if relations $\equiv_l$, $\equiv_t$ and $\equiv_r$ exist that satisfy certain conditions, in particular, they all have finite index. We show that the symbolic language associated to a register automaton is regular, and we construct, for each regular symbolic language, a register automaton that accepts this language. Our result provides a foundation for grey-box learning algorithms in settings where the constraints on data parameters can be extracted from code using e.g. tools for symbolic/concolic execution or tainting. We believe that moving to a grey-box setting is essential to overcome the scalability problems of state-of-the-art black-box learning algorithms."

It is effective at bridging the reality gap between design-time assumptions and run-time environments; which is especially useful for robotic systems, because they operate in the real-world. This paper presents an RV approach that uses a Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) model, derived from natural-language safety documents, as a runtime monitor. We describe our modelling process and monitoring toolchain, Varanus. The approach is demonstrated on a teleoperated robotic system, called MASCOT, which enables remote operations inside a nuclear reactor. We show how the safety design documents for the MASCOT system were modelled (including how modelling revealed an underspecification in the document) and evaluate the utility of the Varanus toolchain. As far as we know, this is the first RV approach to directly use a CSP model. This approach provides traceability of the safety properties from the documentation to the system, a verified monitor for RV, and validation of the safety documents themselves."

Models discussed in the literature differ in the detection capabilities of the agents residing at the nodes of the network (detecting the set of states of their neighbors, or counting the number of neighbors in each state), the notion of acceptance (acceptance by halting in a particular configuration, or by stable consensus), the notion of step (synchronous move, interleaving, or arbitrary timing), and the fairness assumptions (non-starving, or stochastic-like). We study the expressive power of the combinations of these features, and show that the initially twenty possible combinations fit into seven equivalence classes. The classification is the consequence of several equi-expressivity results with a clear interpretation. In particular, we show that acceptance by halting configuration only has non-trivial expressive power if it is combined with counting, and that synchronous and interleaving models have the same power as those in which an arbitrary set of nodes can move at the same time. We also identify simple graph properties that distinguish the expressive power of the seven classes."

In this paper, we present $\mathsf{IMC}^2$, a specific algorithm for proving B\""uchi automata non-inclusion $\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{A}) \not\subseteq \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{B})$, based on Grosu and Smolka's algorithm $\mathsf{MC}^2$ developed for Monte Carlo model checking against LTL formulas.

With such a number of samples, $\mathsf{IMC}^2$ ensures that the probability of witnessing $\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{A}) \not\subseteq \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{B})$ via further sampling is less than $\delta$, under the assumption that the probability of finding a lasso counterexample is larger than $\epsilon$. Extensive experimental evaluation shows that $\mathsf{IMC}^2$ is a fast and reliable way to find counterexamples to B\""uchi automata inclusion."

In this work, we focus on extracted view maintenance, a problem that is well-motivated and thoroughly addressed in the relational setting.

We formally characterize three classes of document updates, namely those that are irrelevant, autonomously computable, and pseudo-irrelevant with respect to a given extractor.

In this paper, we consider permissive strategies as a way to overcome this problem: such strategies propose intervals of delays instead of single delays, and aim at reaching a target state whichever delay actually takes place.

The agent can query for the membership of words in the target language, or propose a candidate model and verify its equivalence to the target. The major difficulty of this framework is the inference of clock resets, central to the dynamics of timed automata, but not directly observable. Interesting first steps have already been made by restricting to the subclass of event-recording automata, where clock resets are tied to observations. In order to advance towards learning of general timed automata, we generalize this method to a new class, called reset-free event-recording automata, where some transitions may reset no clocks. This offers the same challenges as generic timed automata while keeping the simpler framework of event-recording automata for the sake of readability. Central to our contribution is the notion of invalidity, and the algorithm and data structures to deal with it, allowing on-the-fly detection and pruning of reset hypotheses that contradict observations, a key to any efficient active-learning procedure for generic timed automata."

Such extensions could potentially be used for the verification of influence networks or statistical reasoning. Unfortunately, as we prove in the paper, it turns out that percentage extensions of even tiny fragments of LTL have undecidable satisfiability and model-checking problems. Our undecidability proofs not only sharpen most of the undecidability results on logics with arithmetics interpreted on words known from the literature, but also are fairly simple. We also show that the undecidability can be avoided by restricting the allowed usage of the negation, and briefly discuss how the undecidability results transfer to first-order logic on words."

However, RL methods often fail to generalize to safety-critical scenarios since policies are overfitted to training environments. Previously, robust adversarial reinforcement learning (RARL) was proposed to train an adversarial network that applies disturbances to a system, which improves robustness in test scenarios. A drawback of neural-network-based adversaries is that integrating system requirements without handcrafting sophisticated reward signals is difficult. Safety falsification methods allow one to find a set of initial conditions as well as an input sequence, such that the system violates a given property formulated in temporal logic. In this paper, we propose falsification-based RARL (FRARL), the first generic framework for integrating temporal-logic falsification in adversarial learning to improve policy robustness. With falsification method, we do not need to construct an extra reward function for the adversary. We evaluate our approach on a braking assistance system and an adaptive cruise control system of autonomous vehicles. Experiments show that policies trained with a falsification-based adversary generalize better and show less violation of the safety specification in test scenarios than the ones trained without an adversary or with an adversarial network."

While decidability of the problem in full generality remains an open question, there are several subclasses for which decidability has been shown: It is decidable for (i) one-dimensional VASS, (ii) VASS coverability languages, (iii) languages of integer VASS, and (iv) commutative VASS languages. We propose a general approach to deciding regular separability. We use it to decide regular separability of an arbitrary VASS language from any language in the classes (i), (ii), and (iii). This generalizes all previous results, including (iv)."

This paper presents a transformation from nondeterministic Streett automata (NSA) with $n$ states and $k$ Streett pairs to equivalent deterministic Rabin transition automata (DRTA) with $n^{5n}(n!)^{n}$ states, $O(n^{n^2})$ Rabin pairs for $k=\omega(n)$ and $n^{5n}k^{nk}$ states, $O(k^{nk})$ Rabin pairs for $k=O(n)$. This improves the state of the art Streett determinization construction with $n^{5n}(n!)^{n+1}$ states, $O(n^2)$ Rabin pairs and $n^{5n}k^{nk}n!$ states, $O(nk)$ Rabin pairs, respectively. Moreover, deterministic parity transition automata (DPTA) are obtained with $3(n(n+1)-1)!(n!)^{n+1}$ states, $2n(n+1)$ priorities for $k=\omega(n)$ and $3(n(k+1)-1)!n!k^{nk}$ states, $2n(k+1)$ priorities for $k=O(n)$, which improves the best construction with $n^{n}(k+1)^{n(k+1)}(n(k+1)-1)!$ states, $2n(k+1)$ priorities. Further, we prove a lower bound state complexity for determinization construction from NSA to deterministic Rabin (transition) automata i.e. $n^{5n}(n!)^{n}$ for $k=\omega(n)$ and $n^{5n}k^{nk}$ for $k=O(n)$, which matches the state complexity of the proposed determinization construction. Besides, we put forward a lower bound state complexity for determinization construction from NSA to deterministic parity (transition) automata i.e. $2^{\Omega(n^2 \log n)}$ for $k=\omega(n)$ and $2^{\Omega(nk \log nk)}$ for $k=O(n)$, which is the same as the state complexity of the proposed determinization construction in the exponent."

Those challenges make industrial environments a suitable scenario to apply all modern reinforcement learning (RL) concepts. The main difficulty, however, is the lack of that industrial environments. In this way, this work presents the concept and the implementation of a tool that allows us to convert any dynamic system modeled as an FSM to the open-source Gym wrapper. After that, it is possible to employ any RL methods to optimize any desired task. In the first tests of the proposed tool, we show traditional Q-learning and Deep Q-learning methods running over two simple environments."

Firstly, we formulate the notions of concurrent composition, observer, and detector for $\mathcal{A}^{\mathfrak{M}}$. Secondly, we use the concurrent composition to give an equivalent condition for SD, use the detector to give an equivalent condition for SPD, and use the observer to give equivalent conditions for WD and WPD, all for general $\mathcal{A}^{\mathfrak{M}}$ without any assumption. Thirdly, we prove that for a labeled weighted automaton over monoid $(\mathbb{Q}^k,+)$ (denoted by $\mathcal{A}^{\mathbb{Q}^k}$), its concurrent composition, observer, and detector can be computed in NP, $2$-EXPTIME, and $2$-EXPTIME, respectively, by developing novel connections between $\mathcal{A}^{\mathbb{Q}^k}$ and the NP-complete exact path length problem (proved by [Nyk\""{a}nen and Ukkonen, 2002]) and a subclass of Presburger arithmetic. As a result, we prove that for $\mathcal{A}^{\mathbb{Q}^k}$, SD can be verified in coNP, while SPD, WD, and WPD can be verified in $2$-EXPTIME. Particularly, for $\mathcal{A}^{\mathbb{Q}^k}$ in which from every state, a distinct state can be reached through some unobservable, instantaneous path, its detector can be computed in NP, and SPD can be verified in coNP. Finally, we prove that the problems of verifying SD and SPD of deterministic $\mathcal{A}^{\mathbb{N}}$ over monoid $(\mathbb{N},+)$ are both NP-hard. The original methods developed in this paper will provide foundations for characterizing other fundamental properties (e.g., diagnosability and opacity) in $\mathcal{A}^{\mathfrak{M}}$."

We characterize a subset of NL for which verification with arbitrarily low error is possible by these extremely weak machines. It turns out that, for any $\varepsilon>0$, one can construct a constant-coin, constant-space verifier operating within error $\varepsilon$ for every language that is recognizable by a linear-time multi-head nondeterministic finite automaton (2nfa($k$)).

In this paper we look for morphisms of the free monoid, which allow to construct new rich words from already known rich words. We focus on morphisms in Class $P_{ret}$. This class contains morphisms injective on the alphabet and satisfying a particular palindromicity property: for every morphism $\varphi$ in the class there exists a palindrome $w$ such that $\varphi(a)w$ is a first complete return word to $w$ for each letter $a$. We characterize $P_{ret}$ morphisms which preserve richness over a binary alphabet. We also study marked $P_{ret}$ morphisms acting on alphabets with more letters.

We show that rational subset membership for Baumslag-Solitar groups $\text{BS}(1,q)$ with $q\ge 2$ is decidable and PSPACE-complete. To this end, we introduce a word representation of the elements of $\text{BS}(1,q)$: their pointed expansion (PE), an annotated $q$-ary expansion. Seeing subsets of $\text{BS}(1,q)$ as word languages, this leads to a natural notion of PE-regular subsets of $\text{BS}(1, q)$: these are the subsets of $\text{BS}(1,q)$ whose sets of PE are regular languages. Our proof shows that every rational subset of $\text{BS}(1,q)$ is PE-regular.   Since the class of PE-regular subsets of $\text{BS}(1,q)$ is well-equipped with closure properties, we obtain further applications of these results. Our results imply that (i) emptiness of Boolean combinations of rational subsets is decidable, (ii) membership to each fixed rational subset of $\text{BS}(1,q)$ is decidable in logarithmic space, and (iii) it is decidable whether a given rational subset is recognizable. In particular, it is decidable whether a given finitely generated subgroup of $\text{BS}(1,q)$ has finite index."

As a consequence, techniques of formal verification have been recognized as crucial to the design and deployment of safe NNs. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to formally verify the most commonly considered safety specifications for ReLU NNs -- i.e. polytopic specifications on the input and output of the network. Like some other approaches, ours uses a relaxed convex program to mitigate the combinatorial complexity of the problem. However, unique in our approach is the way we use a convex solver not only as a linear feasibility checker, but also as a means of penalizing the amount of relaxation allowed in solutions. In particular, we encode each ReLU by means of the usual linear constraints, and combine this with a convex objective function that penalizes the discrepancy between the output of each neuron and its relaxation. This convex function is further structured to force the largest relaxations to appear closest to the input layer; this provides the further benefit that the most problematic neurons are conditioned as early as possible, when conditioning layer by layer. This paradigm can be leveraged to create a verification algorithm that is not only faster in general than competing approaches, but is also able to verify considerably more safety properties; we evaluated PEREGRiNN on a standard MNIST robustness verification suite to substantiate these claims."

The abstraction sets the guard and reset of an abstract edge to be the union of the symmetry-transformed guards and resets of the concrete edges.

Our abstraction results in simpler automata, that are more amenable for formal analysis and design.

We show how a fixed point of the reachable set computation of B can be used to answer reachability queries for A, even if the latter visits an infinite and unbounded sequences of modes. We present our implementation of the abstraction construction, the fixed point check, and the map that transforms abstract reachable sets to concrete ones in a software tool.

Traditionally, those systems were small and self-contained, and the main challenge for model-based evaluation has been the efficiency of the solution process. Recently, the problem of specifying and maintaining complex models has increasingly gained attention, as modern systems are characterized by many components and complex interactions. Components share similarities, but also exhibit variations in their behavior due to different configurations or roles in the system. From the modeling perspective, variations lead to replicating and altering a small set of base models multiple times. Variability is taken into account only informally, by defining a sample model and explaining its possible variations. In this paper we address the problem of including variability in performability models, focusing on Stochastic Activity Networks (SANs). We introduce the formal definition of Stochastic Activity Networks Templates (SAN-T), a formalism based on SANs with the addition of variability aspects. Differently from other approaches, parameters can also affect the structure of the model, like the number of cases of activities. We apply the SAN-T formalism to the modeling of the backbone network of an environmental monitoring infrastructure. In particular, we show how existing SAN models from the literature can be generalized using the newly introduced formalism."

Solving such a query involves computing a subformula that can be inserted into the query so that the resulting grounded formula is satisfied by all data streams in the set.

Since CFGs are the languages recognized by pushdown automata (PDA), it suffices to determine the state transition rules and stack action rules of the corresponding PDA. An approach would be to train a recurrent neural network (RNN) to classify the sample data and attempt to extract these PDA rules. But neural networks are not a priori aware of the structure of a PDA and would likely require many samples to infer this structure. Furthermore, extracting the PDA rules from the RNN is nontrivial. We build a RNN specifically structured like a PDA, where weights correspond directly to the PDA rules. This requires a stack architecture that is somehow differentiable (to enable gradient-based learning) and stable (an unstable stack will show deteriorating performance with longer strings). We propose a stack architecture that is differentiable and that provably exhibits orbital stability. Using this stack, we construct a neural network that provably approximates a PDA for strings of arbitrary length. Moreover, our model and method of proof can easily be generalized to other state machines, such as a Turing Machine."

The main novelty of Tarsis is that it works over an alphabet of strings instead of single characters. On the one hand, such approach requires a more complex and refined definition of the widening operator, and the abstract semantics of string operators. On the other hand, it is in position to obtain strictly more precise results than than state-of-the-art approaches. We implemented a prototype of Tarsis, and we applied it on some case studies taken from some of the most popular Java libraries manipulating string values. The experimental results confirm that Tarsis is in position to obtain strictly more precise results than existing analyses."

Endomorphisms of this tree (i.e. solenoid maps) are in one-to-one correspondence with 1-Lipschitz mappings from $\mathbb Z_d$ to itself and automorphisms of $T_d$ constitute the group $\mathrm{Isom}(\mathbb Z_d)$. In the case when $d=p$ is prime, Anashin showed that $f\in\mathrm{Lip}^1(\mathbb Z_p)$ is defined by a finite Mealy automaton if and only if the reduced coefficients of its van der Put series constitute a $p$-automatic sequence over a finite subset of $\mathbb Z_p\cap\mathbb Q$. We generalize this result to arbitrary integer $d\geq 2$, describe the explicit connection between the Moore automaton producing such sequence and the Mealy automaton inducing the corresponding endomorphism. Along the process we produce two algorithms allowing to convert the Mealy automaton of an endomorphism to the corresponding Moore automaton generating the sequence of the reduced van der Put coefficients of the induced map on $\mathbb Z_d$ and vice versa. We demonstrate examples of applications of these algorithms for the case when the sequence of coefficients is Thue-Morse sequence, and also for one of the generators of the standard automaton representation of the lamplighter group."

Together with first-order completeness of linear temporal logic these results constitute a theoretical foundation for model-checking algorithms. Extending these results to structured subclasses of context-free languages, such as tree-languages did not work as smoothly: for instance W. Thomas showed that there are star-free tree languages that are counting. We show, instead, that investigating the same properties within the family of operator precedence languages leads to equivalences that perfectly match those on regular languages. The study of this old family of context-free languages has been recently resumed to enhance not only parsing (the original motivation of its inventor R. Floyd) but also to exploit their algebraic and logic properties. We have been able to reproduce the classic results of regular languages for this much larger class by going back to string languages rather than tree languages. Since operator precedence languages strictly include other classes of structured languages such as visibly pushdown languages, the same results given in this paper hold as trivial corollary for that family too."

Finite-valued transducers are those for which there is a finite upper bound on the number of output words that the relation associates with every input word.

They infer global inductive invariants via local reasoning about a single step of the transition relation of a system, while employing SMT-based procedures, such as interpolation, to mitigate the limitations of local reasoning and allow for better generalization. Unfortunately, these mitigations intertwine model checking with heuristics of the underlying SMT-solver, negatively affecting stability of model checking. In this paper, we propose to tackle the limitations of locality in a systematic manner. We introduce explicit global guidance into the local reasoning performed by IC3-style algorithms. To this end, we extend the SMT-IC3 paradigm with three novel rules, designed to mitigate fundamental sources of failure that stem from locality. We instantiate these rules for the theory of Linear Integer Arithmetic and implement them on top of SPACER solver in Z3. Our empirical results show that GSPACER, SPACER extended with global guidance, is significantly more effective than both SPACER and sole global reasoning, and, furthermore, is insensitive to interpolation."

However, the promise held by these algorithms cannot be kept without proper attention to the considerably stronger design constraints that arise when the applications of interest, such as aerospace systems, are safety-critical. Formal verification is the process of proving or disproving the ''correctness'' of an algorithm with respect to a certain mathematical description of it by means of a computer. This article discusses the formal verification of the Ellipsoid method, a convex optimization algorithm, and its code implementation as it applies to receding horizon control. Options for encoding code properties and their proofs are detailed. The applicability and limitations of those code properties and proofs are presented as well.

We combine an SMT based over-approximation to prove that some behaviors are unfeasible, an under-approximation using memory-less sampling of runs to find witness traces or counter-examples, and a set of structural reduction rules that can simplify both the system and the property.

2020-05-23 15:19:57+00:00,2020-05-23 15:19:57+00:00,"Stone-type dualities provide a powerful mathematical framework for studying properties of logical systems. They have recently been fruitfully explored in understanding minimisation of various types of automata. In Bezhanishvili et al. (2012), a dual equivalence between a category of coalgebras and a category of algebras was used to explain minimisation. The algebraic semantics is dual to a coalgebraic semantics in which logical equivalence coincides with trace equivalence. It follows that maximal quotients of coalgebras correspond to minimal subobjects of algebras. Examples include partially observable deterministic finite automata, linear weighted automata viewed as coalgebras over finite-dimensional vector spaces, and belief automata, which are coalgebras on compact Hausdorff spaces. In Bonchi et al. (2014), Brzozowski's double-reversal minimisation algorithm for deterministic finite automata was described categorically and its correctness explained via the duality between reachability and observability. This work includes generalisations of Brzozowski's algorithm to Moore and weighted automata over commutative semirings.   In this paper we propose a general categorical framework within which such minimisation algorithms can be understood. The goal is to provide a unifying perspective based on duality. Our framework consists of a stack of three interconnected adjunctions: a base dual adjunction that can be lifted to a dual adjunction between coalgebras and algebras and also to a dual adjunction between automata. The approach provides an abstract understanding of reachability and observability. We illustrate the general framework on range of concrete examples, including deterministic Kripke frames, weighted automata, topological automata (belief automata), and alternating automata."

We say that a submonoid $M$ generated by $k$ elements of $A^*$ is {\em $k$-maximal} if there does not exist another submonoid generated by at most $k$ words containing $M$. We call a set $X \subseteq A^*$ {\em primitive} if it is the basis of a $|X|$-maximal submonoid. This definition encompasses the notion of primitive word -- in fact, $\{w\}$ is a primitive set if and only if $w$ is a primitive word. By definition, for any set $X$, there exists a primitive set $Y$ such that $X \subseteq Y^*$. We therefore call $Y$ a {\em primitive root} of $X$. As a main result, we prove that if a set has rank $2$, then it has a unique primitive root. To obtain this result, we prove that the intersection of two $2$-maximal submonoids is either the empty word or a submonoid generated by one single primitive word. For a single word $w$, we say that the set $\{x,y\}$ is a {\em bi-root} of $w$ if $w$ can be written as a concatenation of copies of $x$ and $y$ and $\{x,y\}$ is a primitive set. We prove that every primitive word $w$ has at most one bi-root $\{x,y\}$ such that $|x|+|y|<\sqrt{|w|}$. That is, the bi-root of a word is unique provided the word is sufficiently long with respect to the size (sum of lengths) of the root. Our results are also compared to previous approaches that investigate pseudo-repetitions, where a morphic involutive function $\theta$ is defined on $A^*$. In this setting, the notions of $\theta$-power, $\theta$-primitive and $\theta$-root are defined, and it is shown that any word has a unique $\theta$-primitive root. This result can be obtained with our approach by showing that a word $w$ is $\theta$-primitive if and only if $\{w, \theta(w)\}$ is a primitive set."

Fresh-register automata extend register automata with the capability to generate fresh symbols in order to model computational scenarios involving name creation. This paper investigates the complexity of the bisimilarity problem for classes of register and fresh-register automata. We examine all main disciplines that have appeared in the literature: general register assignments; assignments where duplicate register values are disallowed; and assignments without duplicates in which registers cannot be empty. In the general case, we show that the problem is EXPTIME-complete.   However, the absence of duplicate values in registers enables us to identify inherent symmetries inside the associated bisimulation relations, which can be used to establish a polynomial bound on the depth of Attacker-winning strategies. Furthermore, they enable a highly succinct representation of the corresponding bisimulations. By exploiting results from group theory and computational group theory, we can then show solvability in PSPACE and NP respectively for the latter two register disciplines. In each case, we find that freshness does not affect the complexity class of the problem.   The results allow us to close a complexity gap for language equivalence of deterministic register automata. We show that deterministic language inequivalence for the no-duplicates fragment is NP-complete, which disproves an old conjecture of Sakamoto.   Finally, we discover that, unlike in the finite-alphabet case, the addition of pushdown store makes bisimilarity undecidable, even in the case of visibly pushdown storage."

The language accepted by an OCN (defined by reaching a final control state) is monotone in both parameters. This yields two natural questions: 1) Does there exist an initial counter value that makes the language universal? 2) Does there exist a sufficiently high ceiling so that the bounded language is universal? Although the ordinary universality problem is decidable (and Ackermann-complete) and these parameterized problems seem to reduce to checking basic structural properties of the underlying automaton, we show that in fact both problems are undecidable. We also look into the complexities of the problems for several decidable subclasses, namely for unambiguous, and deterministic systems, and for those over a single-letter alphabet."
2020-05-06 05:13:23+00:00,2020-12-14 04:27:26+00:00,"Streaming Data String Transducers (SDSTs) were introduced to model a class of imperative and a class of functional programs, manipulating lists of data items. These can be used to write commonly used routines such as insert, delete and reverse. SDSTs can handle data values from a potentially infinite data domain. The model of Streaming String Transducers (SSTs) is the fragment of SDSTs where the infinite data domain is dropped and only finite alphabets are considered. SSTs have been much studied from a language theoretical point of view. We introduce data back into SSTs, just like data was introduced to finite state automata to get register automata. The result is Streaming String Register Transducers (SSRTs), which is a subclass of SDSTs. SDSTs can compare data values using a linear order on the data domain, which can not be done by SSRTs.   We give a machine independent characterization of SSRTs with origin semantics, along the lines of Myhill-Nerode theorem. Machine independent characterizations for similar models have formed the basis of learning algorithms and enabled us to understand fragments of the models. Origin semantics of transducers track which positions of the output originate from which positions of the input. Although a restriction, using origin semantics is well justified and known to simplify many problems related to transducers. We use origin semantics as a technical building block, in addition to characterizations of deterministic register automata. However, we need to build more on top of these to overcome some challenges unique to SSRTs."

The second version of Automata Tutor supported automatic grading and feedback for finite-automata constructions and has already been used by thousands of users in dozens of countries. This new version of Automata Tutor supports automated grading and feedback generation for a greatly extended variety of new problems, including problems that ask students to create regular expressions, context-free grammars, pushdown automata and Turing machines corresponding to a given description, and problems about converting between equivalent models - e.g., from regular expressions to nondeterministic finite automata. Moreover, for several problems, this new version also enables teachers and students to automatically generate new problem instances. We also present the results of a survey run on a class of 950 students, which shows very positive results about the usability and usefulness of the tool."

In this paper, we extend this algorithmic question to deterministic automata beyond finite automata. We prove that the question of synchronizability becomes undecidable even when looking at deterministic one-counter automata. This is also true for another classical mild extension of regularity, namely that of deterministic one-turn push-down automata. However, when we combine both restrictions, we arrive at scenarios with a PSPACE-complete (and hence decidable) synchronizability problem. Likewise, we arrive at a decidable synchronizability problem for (partially) blind deterministic counter automata.   There are several interpretations of what synchronizability should mean for deterministic push-down automata. This is depending on the role of the stack: should it be empty on synchronization, should it be always the same or is it arbitrary? For the automata classes studied in this paper, the complexity or decidability status of the synchronizability problem is mostly independent of this technicality, but we also discuss one class of automata where this makes a difference."

Here, a synchronizing word w does not only map all states to the same state but also fulfills some conditions on the stack content of each run after reading w. We consider three types of these stack constraints: after reading w, the stack (1) is empty in each run, (2) contains the same sequence of stack symbols in each run, or (3) contains an arbitrary sequence which is independent of the other runs. We show that in contrast to general deterministic push-down automata, it is decidable for deterministic visibly push-down automata whether there exists a synchronizing word with each of these stack constraints, i.e., the problems are in EXPTIME. Under the constraint (1) the problem is even in P. For the sub-classes of deterministic very visibly push-down automata the problem is in P for all three types of constraints. We further study variants of the synchronization problem where the number of turns in the stack height behavior caused by a synchronizing word is restricted, as well as the problem of synchronizing a variant of a sequential transducer, which shows some visibly behavior, by a word that synchronizes the states and produces the same output on all runs."

In 2013, Frid, Puzynina, and Zamboni conjectured that: If $w$ is an infinite word and $k$ is an integer such that $\text{PL}(u)\leq k$ for every factor $u$ of $w$ then $w$ is ultimately periodic.   Suppose that $w$ is an infinite word and $k$ is an integer such $\text{PL}(u)\leq k$ for every factor $u$ of $w$. Let $\Omega(w,k)$ be the set of all factors $u$ of $w$ that have more than $\sqrt[k]{k^{-1}\vert u\vert}$ palindromic prefixes. We show that $\Omega(w,k)$ is an infinite set and we show that for each positive integer $j$ there are palindromes $a,b$ and a word $u\in \Omega(w,k)$ such that $(ab)^j$ is a factor of $u$ and $b$ is nonempty. Note that $(ab)^j$ is a periodic word and $(ab)^ia$ is a palindrome for each $i\leq j$. These results justify the following question: What is the palindromic length of a concatenation of a suffix of $b$ and a periodic word $(ab)^j$ with ""many"" periodic palindromes?   It is known that $\lvert\text{PL}(uv)-\text{PL}(u)\rvert\leq \text{PL}(v)$, where $u$ and $v$ are nonempty words. The main result of our article shows that if $a,b$ are palindromes, $b$ is nonempty, $u$ is a nonempty suffix of $b$, $\vert ab\vert$ is the minimal period of $aba$, and $j$ is a positive integer with $j\geq3\text{PL}(u)$ then $\text{PL}(u(ab)^j)-\text{PL}(u)\geq 0$."

One-counter automata are obtained by extending classical finite-state automata with a counter whose value can range over non-negative integers and be tested for zero. The updates and tests applicable to the counter can further be made parametric by introducing a set of integer-valued variables called parameters. The synthesis problem for such automata asks whether there exists a valuation of the parameters such that all infinite runs of the automaton satisfy some omega-regular property. Lechner showed that (the complement of) the problem can be encoded in a restricted one-alternation fragment of Presburger arithmetic with divisibility. In this work (i) we argue that said fragment, called AERPADPLUS, is unfortunately undecidable. Nevertheless, by a careful re-encoding of the problem into a decidable restriction of AERPADPLUS, (ii) we prove that the synthesis problem is decidable in general and in N2EXP for several fixed omega-regular properties. Finally, (iii) we give a polynomial-space algorithm for the special case of the problem where parameters can only be used in tests, and not updates, of the counter."

We provide a reformulation of regular model checking with length-preserving transducers in terms of existential second-order theory over automatic structures. We argue that this is a natural formulation that enables us tap into powerful synthesis techniques that have been extensively studied in the software verification community. More precisely, in this formulation the first-order part represents the verification conditions for the desired correctness property (for which we have complete solvers), whereas the existentially quantified second-order variables represent the relations to be synthesized. We show that many interesting correctness properties can be formulated in this way, examples being safety, liveness, bisimilarity, and games. More importantly, we show that this new formulation allows new interesting benchmarks (and old regular model checking benchmarks that were previously believed to be difficult), especially in the domain of parameterized system verification, to be solved."

Some years later, Chang, Manna, and Pnueli built on this result to derive a similar normal form for LTL. Both normalisation procedures have a non-elementary worst-case blow-up, and follow an involved path from formulas to counter-free automata to star-free regular expressions and back to formulas. We improve on both points. We present a direct and purely syntactic normalisation procedure for LTL yielding a normal form, comparable to the one by Chang, Manna, and Pnueli, that has only a single exponential blow-up. As an application, we derive a simple algorithm to translate LTL into deterministic Rabin automata. The algorithm normalises the formula, translates it into a special very weak alternating automaton, and applies a simple determinisation procedure, valid only for these special automata."

State-of-the-art language technology scans the acoustically analyzed speech signal for relevant keywords that are subsequently inserted into semantic slots to interpret the user's intent. In order to develop proper cognitive information and communication technologies, simple slot-filling should be replaced by utterance meaning transducers (UMT) that are based on semantic parsers and a mental lexicon, comprising syntactic, phonetic and semantic features of the language under consideration. This lexicon must be acquired by a cognitive agent during interaction with its users. We outline a reinforcement learning algorithm for the acquisition of syntax and semantics of English utterances, based on minimalist grammar (MG), a recent computational implementation of generative linguistics. English declarative sentences are presented to the agent by a teacher in form of utterance meaning pairs (UMP) where the meanings are encoded as formulas of predicate logic. Since MG codifies universal linguistic competence through inference rules, thereby separating innate linguistic knowledge from the contingently acquired lexicon, our approach unifies generative grammar and reinforcement learning, hence potentially resolving the still pending Chomsky-Skinner controversy."

A particular and remarkable consequence is that a word $w$ is a standard word if and only if its reversal is a solution to the word equation and $\gcd(|w|, |w|_1) = 1$. This result can be interpreted as a yet another characterization for standard Sturmian words.   We apply our results to the symbolic square root map $\sqrt{\cdot}$ studied by the first author and M. A. Whiteland. We prove that if the language of a minimal subshift $\Omega$ contains infinitely many solutions to the word equation, then either $\Omega$ is Sturmian and $\sqrt{\cdot}$-invariant or $\Omega$ is a so-called SL-subshift and not $\sqrt{\cdot}$-invariant. This result is progress towards proving the conjecture that a minimal and $\sqrt{\cdot}$-invariant subshift is necessarily Sturmian."

Current clinical practice is to insert needles under image guidance or haptic feedback, although that may involve reinsertions and adjustments since the needle and its interaction with the tissue during insertion cannot be completely controlled. (Automated) needle steering could in theory improve the accuracy with which a target is reached and thus reduce surgical traumata especially for minimally invasive procedures, e.g., brachytherapy or biopsy. Yet, flexible needles and needle-tissue interaction are both complex and expensive to model and can often be computed approximatively only. In this paper we propose to employ timed games to navigate flexible needles with a bevel tip to reach a fixed target in tissue. We use a simple non-holonomic model of needle-tissue interaction, which abstracts in particular from the various physical forces involved and appears to be simplistic compared to related models from medical robotics. Based on the model, we synthesize strategies from which we can derive sufficiently precise motion plans to steer the needle in soft tissue. However, applying those strategies in practice, one is faced with the problem of an unpredictable behavior of the needle at the initial insertion point. Our proposal is to implement a preprocessing step to initialize the model based on data from the real system, once the needle is inserted. Taking into account the actual needle tip angle and position, we generate strategies to reach the desired target. We have implemented the model in Uppaal Stratego and evaluated it on steering a flexible needle in gelatin phantoms; gelatin phantoms are commonly used in medical technology to simulate the behavior of soft tissue. The experiments show that strategies can be synthesized for both generated and measured needle motions with a maximum deviation of 1.84mm."

More interestingly, we also show that the problem remains decidable even when the maximal numerical constant is not specified in advance, which is an important technical novelty not present in previous literature on timed games. We complement these two decidability result by showing undecidability when the number of clocks available to Player II is not fixed. As an application of timed games, and our main motivation to study them, we show that they can be used to solve the deterministic separability problem for nondeterministic timed automata with epsilon transitions. This is a novel decision problem about timed automata which has not been studied before. We show that separability is decidable when the number of clocks of the separating automaton is fixed and the maximal constant is not. The problem whether separability is decidable without bounding the number of clocks of the separator remains an interesting open problem."

They provide a simple formalism to specify the behaviour of reactive systems operating over data {\omega}-words. We study the synthesis problem for specifications given as register automata over a linearly ordered data domain (e.g. (N, {\leq}) or (Q, {\leq})), which allow for comparison of data with regards to the linear order. To that end, we extend the classical Church synthesis game to infinite alphabets: two players, Adam and Eve, alternately play some data, and Eve wins whenever their interaction complies with the specification, which is a language of {\omega}-words over ordered data. Such games are however undecidable, even when the specification is recognised by a deterministic register automaton. This is in contrast with the equality case, where the problem is only undecidable for nondeterministic and universal specifications. Thus, we study one-sided Church games, where Eve instead operates over a finite alphabet, while Adam still manipulates data. We show they are determined, and deciding the existence of a winning strategy is in ExpTime, both for Q and N. This follows from a study of constraint sequences, which abstract the behaviour of register automata, and allow us to reduce Church games to {\omega}-regular games. Lastly, we apply these results to the transducer synthesis problem for input-driven register automata, where each output data is restricted to be the content of some register, and show that if there exists an implementation, then there exists one which is a register transducer."

In this paper we introduce a multi-head version of the above automaton. We further show that the multi-head variant is computationally more powerful than one-way multi-head reversible finite automata. In fact we also show that the multi-head variant accepts a language which is not accepted by any one-way multi-head deterministic finite automata.

We formulate two versions of the game as a transformation semigroup and use this formulation to view the game through the lens of Krohn-Rhodes theory. In a variation of the game upon which it restarts if the player loses, we find permutation group structures, including the symmetric group $S_5$ which contains a non-abelian simple group as a subgroup. This implies, at least in a simple case, that iterated Tetris is finitarily computationally universal."

Generalized semiautomata are obtained from stochastic semiautomata by dropping the restrictions imposed by probability. It is well-known that each stochastic semiautomaton can be decomposed into a sequential product of a dependent source and a deterministic semiautomaton making partly use of the celebrated theorem of Birkhoff-von Neumann. It will be shown that each generalized semiautomaton can be partitioned into a sequential product of a generalized dependent source and a deterministic semiautomaton.

The hierarchy is based on two formal properties: space complexity, which measures the RNN's memory, and rational recurrence, defined as whether the recurrent update can be described by a weighted finite-state machine. We place several RNN variants within this hierarchy. For example, we prove the LSTM is not rational, which formally separates it from the related QRNN (Bradbury et al., 2016). We also show how these models' expressive capacity is expanded by stacking multiple layers or composing them with different pooling functions. Our results build on the theory of ""saturated"" RNNs (Merrill, 2019). While formally extending these findings to unsaturated RNNs is left to future work, we hypothesize that the practical learnable capacity of unsaturated RNNs obeys a similar hierarchy. Experimental findings from training unsaturated networks on formal languages support this conjecture."

Thus, one potential way to understand the success of these networks is to revisit the theory of counter computation. Therefore, we study the abilities of real-time counter machines as formal grammars, focusing on formal properties that are relevant for NLP models. We first show that several variants of the counter machine converge to express the same class of formal languages. We also prove that counter languages are closed under complement, union, intersection, and many other common set operations. Next, we show that counter machines cannot evaluate boolean expressions, even though they can weakly validate their syntax. This has implications for the interpretability and evaluation of neural network systems: successfully matching syntactic patterns does not guarantee that counter memory accurately encodes compositional semantics. Finally, we consider whether counter languages are semilinear. This work makes general contributions to the theory of formal languages that are of potential interest for understanding recurrent neural networks."

It is an essential question that emerges in many optimization problems in automata theory. Unfortunately, the general problem can be shown to be undecidable, whereas its bounded decisional version is NP-complete. Designing efficient algorithms that produce approximate solutions to the WMP in reasonable time is an appealing research direction that can lead to several new applications including formal verification of systems abstracted as WFAs. In particular, in combination with a recent procedure that translates a recurrent neural network into a weighted automaton, an algorithm for the WMP can be used to analyze and verify the network by exploiting the simpler and more compact automata model. In this work, we propose, implement and evaluate a metaheuristic based on genetic algorithms to approximate solutions to the WMP. We experimentally evaluate its performance on examples from the literature and show its potential on different applications."

In this paper, we present a solution to the deceptive game in which a control agent is to satisfy a Boolean objective specified by a co-safe temporal logic formula in the presence of an adversary. The agent intentionally introduces asymmetric information to create payoff misperception, which manifests as the misperception of the labeling function in the game model. Thus, the adversary is unable to accurately determine which logical formula is satisfied by a given outcome of the game. We introduce a model called hypergame on graph to capture the asymmetrical information with one-sided payoff misperception. Based on this model, we present the solution of such a hypergame and use the solution to synthesize stealthy deceptive strategies. Specifically, deceptive sure winning and deceptive almost-sure winning strategies are developed by reducing the hypergame to a two-player game and one-player stochastic game with reachability objectives. A running example is introduced to demonstrate the game model and the solution concept used for strategy synthesis."

Failures in safety-critical contexts such as human-robot interactions or even autonomous driving can ultimately lead to loss of life. In this context, this paper aims to provide a method by which one can algorithmically test and evaluate an autonomous system. Given a black-box autonomous system with some operational specifications, we construct a minimax problem based on control barrier functions to generate a family of test parameters designed to optimally evaluate whether the system can satisfy the specifications. To illustrate our results, we utilize the Robotarium as a case study for an autonomous system that claims to satisfy waypoint navigation and obstacle avoidance simultaneously. We demonstrate that the proposed test synthesis framework systematically finds those sequences of events (tests) that identify points of system failure."

More formally, a tandem duplication can be thought of as an operation that converts a string $S = AXB$ into a string $T = AXXB.$ As they appear to be involved in genetic disorders, tandem duplications are widely studied in computational biology. Also, tandem duplication mechanisms have been recently studied in different contexts, from formal languages, to information theory, to error-correcting codes for DNA storage systems.   The problem of determining the complexity of computing the tandem duplication distance between two given strings was proposed by [Leupold et al., 2004] and, very recently, it was shown to be NP-hard for the case of unbounded alphabets [Lafond et al., STACS2020]. In this paper, we significantly improve this result and show that the tandem duplication distance problem is NP-hard already for the case of strings over an alphabet of size $\leq 5.$ We also study some special classes of strings were it is possible to give linear time solutions to the existence problem: given strings $S$ and $T$ over the same alphabet, decide whether there exists a sequence of duplications converting $S$ into $T$. A polynomial time algorithm that solves the existence problem was only known for the case of the binary alphabet."

Besides, the machine learning methods in autonomous systems are mostly data-intensive and lack commonsense knowledge and reasoning that are natural to humans. In this paper, we propose the framework of temporal logic classifier-in-the-loop systems. The temporal logic classifiers can output different actions to take for an autonomous system based on the environment, such that the behavior of the autonomous system can satisfy a given temporal logic specification. Our approach is robust and provably-correct, as we can prove that the behavior of the autonomous system can satisfy a given temporal logic specification in the presence of (bounded) disturbances."

We first approximate the system behavior by simulating finitely many trajectories with timerobust tube segments around them. These time-robust tube segments account for both spatial and temporal uncertainties that exist in the hybrid system with initial state variations. The inferred MTL formulae classify different time-robust tube segments and thus can be used for classifying the hybrid system behaviors in a provably correct fashion. We implement our approach on a model of a smart building testbed to distinguish two cases of room occupancy."

Specifically, given a formal threat model capturing the distributed protocol model and network topology, as well as the placement, goals, and interface (inputs and outputs) of potential attackers, we automatically synthesize an attacker. We formalize four attacker synthesis problems - across attackers that always succeed versus those that sometimes fail, and attackers that attack forever versus those that do not - and we propose algorithmic solutions to two of them. We report on a prototype implementation called KORG and its application to TCP as a case-study. Our experiments show that KORG can automatically generate well-known attacks for TCP within seconds or minutes."

Various operational semantics of the pi-calculus have been proposed, which can be classified according to whether transitions are unlabelled (so-called reductions) or labelled. With labelled transitions, we can distinguish early and late semantics. The early version allows a process to receive names it already knows from the environment, while the late semantics and reduction semantics do not. All existing reversible versions of the pi-calculus use reduction or late semantics, despite the early semantics of the (forward-only) pi-calculus being more widely used than the late. We define piIH, the first reversible early pi-calculus, and give it a denotational semantics in terms of reversible bundle event structures. The new calculus is a reversible form of the internal pi-calculus, which is a subset of the pi-calculus where every link sent by an output is private, yielding greater symmetry between inputs and outputs."

We also show an analogous statement for the case when $\varphi(\bar x,\bar y)$ is a CMSO$_2$ formula and $\cal C$ is a class of graphs with uniformly bounded treewidth. We complement these results by showing that if $\cal C$ has unbounded cliquewidth (respectively, treewidth), then, under some mild technical assumptions on $\cal C$, the set systems definable by CMSO$_1$ (respectively, CMSO$_2$) formulas in graphs from $\cal C$ may have unbounded VC dimension, hence also unbounded VC density."

Additionally there is a finite upper bound on all $p_i$. Manzoni and Umeo have described an algorithm for these (one-dimensional) cellular automata which solves the Firing Squad Synchronization Problem. This algorithm needs linear time (in the number of cells to be synchronized) but for many problem instances it is slower than the optimum time by some positive constant factor. In the present paper we derive lower bounds on possible synchronization times and describe an algorithm which is never slower and in some cases faster than the one by Manzoni and Umeo and which is close to a lower bound (up to a constant summand) in more cases.

The concepts of controllability and observability are defined by means of a ranking function defined on the product automaton, which decreases its value if an accepting state of the product automaton is being approached. The proposed on-line control scheme leverages the ranking function and a permissiveness function, which represents a time-varying permissiveness level.

However, recent work of Radi and Kupferman has shown that minimising Co-Buchi automata with transition based acceptance is tractable, which suggests that the complexity of minimising GFG automata might be cheaper than minimising deterministic automata.   We show for the standard state based acceptance that the minimality of a GFG automaton is NP-complete for Buchi, Co-Buchi, and parity GFG automata. The proofs are a surprisingly straight forward generalisation of the proofs from deterministic Buchi automata: they use a similar reductions, and the same hard class of languages."

The Strahler number of a parity game is proposed to be defined as the smallest Strahler number of the tree of any of its attractor decompositions. It is proved that parity games can be solved in quasi-linear space and in time that is polynomial in the number of vertices~$n$ and linear in $({d}/{2k})^k$, where $d$ is the number of priorities and $k$ is the Strahler number. This complexity is quasi-polynomial because the Strahler number is at most logarithmic in the number of vertices. The proof is based on a new construction of small Strahler-universal trees.   It is shown that the Strahler number of a parity game is a robust parameter: it coincides with its alternative version based on trees of progress measures and with the register number defined by Lehtinen~(2018). It follows that parity games can be solved in quasi-linear space and in time that is polynomial in the number of vertices and linear in $({d}/{2k})^k$, where $k$ is the register number. This significantly improves the running times and space achieved for parity games of bounded register number by Lehtinen (2018) and by Parys (2020).   The running time of the algorithm based on small Strahler-universal trees yields a novel trade-off $k \cdot \lg(d/k) = O(\log n)$ between the two natural parameters that measure the structural complexity of a parity game, which allows solving parity games in polynomial time. This includes as special cases the asymptotic settings of those parameters covered by the results of Calude, Jain Khoussainov, Li, and Stephan (2017), of Jurdzi\'nski and Lazi\'c (2017), and of Lehtinen (2018), and it significantly extends the range of such settings, for example to $d = 2^{O\left(\sqrt{\lg n}\right)}$ and $k = O\!\left(\sqrt{\lg n}\right)$."

Especially in systems that are intrinsically safety-critical, a dedicated monitoring component inspecting data streams to detect problems at runtime greatly increases the confidence in a safe execution. Such a monitor needs to be based on a specification language capable of expressing complex, high-level properties using only the accessible low-level signals. Moreover, tight constraints on computational resources exacerbate the requirements on the monitor. Thus, several existing approaches to monitoring are not applicable due to their dependence on an operating system. We present an FPGA-based monitoring approach by compiling an RTLola specification into synthesizable VHDL code. RTLola is a stream-based specification language capable of expressing complex real-time properties while providing an upper bound on the execution time and memory requirements. The statically determined memory bound allows for a compilation to an FPGA with a fixed size. An advantage of FPGAs is a simple integration process in existing systems and superb executing time. The compilation results in a highly parallel implementation thanks to the modular nature of RTLola specifications. This further increases the maximal event rate the monitor can handle."

Moreover, there exists an unambiguous finite-state transducer that, on a given word w, outputs the length-lexicographically smallest word larger than w (henceforth called the L-successor of w). In both cases, naive constructions result in an exponential blowup in the number of states. We prove that if L is recognized by a DFA with n states, then $2^{\Theta(\sqrt{n \log n})}$ states are sufficient for a DFA to recognize the subset S(L) of L composed of its lexicographically smallest words. We give a matching lower bound that holds even if S(L) is represented as an NFA. We then show that the same upper and lower bounds hold for an unambiguous finite-state transducer that computes L-successors."

J. \v{C}erny discovered in 1964 a sequence of $n$-state complete DFA possessing a minimal synchronizing word of length $(n-1)^2$. The hypothesis, mostly known today as \v{C}erny conjecture, claims that $(n-1)^2$ is a precise upper bound on the length of such a word over alphabet $\Sigma$ of letters on edges of $\Gamma$ for every complete $n$-state DFA. The hypothesis was formulated in 1966 by Starke. Algebra with nonstandard operation over special class of matrices induced by words in the alphabet of labels on edges is used to prove the conjecture. The proof is based on the connection between length of words $u$ and dimension of the space generated by solution $L_x$ of matrix equation $M_uL_x=M_s$ for synchronizing word $s$, as well as on relation between ranks of $M_u$ and $L_x$. Important role below placed the notion of pseudo inverseL matrix, sometimes reversible."

We consider the Int_reg-problem for a number of different graph problems and give general criteria that give decision procedures for these Int_reg-problems. To achieve this goal, we consider a natural graph encoding so that the language of all graph encodings is regular. Then, we draw the connection between classical pumping- and interchange-arguments from the field of formal language theory with the graph operations induced on the encoded graph. Our techniques apply among others to the Int_reg-problem of well-known graph problems like Vertex Cover and Independent Set, as well as to subgraph problems, graph-edit problems and graph-partitioning problems, including coloring problems."

These groups can be interpreted as groups of finite state machines or as subgroups of topological full groups, on effective subshifts over other torsion groups. We define a recursion-theoretic property of a set of natural numbers, called impredictability, which roughly states that a Turing machine can enumerate numbers such that every Turing machine occasionally ""correctly guesses"" whether they are in the language (by halting on them or not), even if trying not to, and given an oracle for shorter identities. We prove that impredictable recursively enumerable sets exist. Combining these constructions and slightly adapting a result of [Salo and T\""orm\""a, 2017], we obtain that four-headed group-walking finite-state automata can define strictly more subshifts than three-headed automata on a group containing a copy of the integers, confirming a conjecture of [Salo and T\""orm\""a, 2017]. These are the first examples of groups where four heads are better than one, and they show the maximal height of a finite head hierarchy is indeed four."

Hyperproperties have been shown to be a powerful formalism for expressing and reasoning about information-flow security policies and important properties of cyber-physical systems such as sensitivity and robustness, as well as consistency conditions in distributed computing such as linearizability. Although there is an extensive body of work on automata-based representation of trace properties, we currently lack such characterization for hyperproperties. We introduce hyperautomata for em hyperlanguages, which are languages over sets of words. Essentially, hyperautomata allow running multiple quantified words over an automaton. We propose a specific type of hyperautomata called nondeterministic finite hyperautomata (NFH), which accept regular hyperlanguages. We demonstrate the ability of regular hyperlanguages to express hyperproperties for finite traces. We then explore the fundamental properties of NFH and show their closure under the Boolean operations. We show that while nonemptiness is undecidable in general, it is decidable for several fragments of NFH. We further show the decidability of the membership problem for finite sets and regular languages for NFH, as well as the containment problem for several fragments of NFH. Finally, we introduce learning algorithms based on Angluin's L-star algorithm for the fragments NFH in which the quantification is either strictly universal or strictly existential."

In order to capture the expressiveness of most modal temporal logics encountered in the literature, we introduce weakly cyclic Terminological Boxes (TBoxes) of MTALC(Dx), whose axioms capture the decreasing property of modal temporal operators. We show the important result that satisfiability of an MTALC(Dx) concept with respect to a weakly cyclic TBox can be reduced to the emptiness problem of a Buchi weak alternating automaton augmented with spatial constraints.

In particular, we show that all automatic sequences orthogonal to periodic sequences are Gowers uniform. As an application, we obtain for any $l \geq 2$ and any automatic set $A \subset \mathbb{N}_0$ lower bounds on the number of $l$-term arithmetic progressions - contained in $A$ - with a given difference.

The models at hand are non-deterministic interface automata, but the interaction between non-determinism and conjunction is not yet well understood. On the other hand, in the theory of alternating automata, conjunction and non-determinism are core aspects. Alternating automata have not been considered in the context of inputs and outputs, making them less suitable for modelling software interfaces. In this paper, we combine the two modelling paradigms to define alternating interface automata (AIA). We equip these automata with an observational, trace-based semantics, and define testers, to establish correctness of black-box interfaces with respect to an AIA specification."

Then, given a function defined by some register transducer, we show that it is decidable (and again, PSpace-complete) whether such function is computable. As for the known finite alphabet case, we show that computability and continuity coincide for functions defined by register transducers, and show how to decide continuity.

In this work we seek to automate the study of solvability and locality: given the description of a graph problem $\Pi$, we would like to determine if $\Pi$ is solvable and what is the asymptotic locality of $\Pi$ as a function of the size of the graph. Put otherwise, we seek to automatically synthesize efficient distributed and parallel algorithms for solving $\Pi$.   We focus on locally checkable graph problems; these are problems in which a solution is globally feasible if it looks feasible in all constant-radius neighborhoods. Prior work on such problems has brought primarily bad news: questions related to locality are undecidable in general, and even if we focus on the case of labeled paths and cycles, determining locality is $\mathsf{PSPACE}$-hard (Balliu et al., PODC 2019).   We complement prior negative results with efficient algorithms for the cases of unlabeled paths and cycles and, as an extension, for rooted trees. We introduce a new automata-theoretic perspective for studying locally checkable graph problems. We represent a locally checkable problem $\Pi$ as a nondeterministic finite automaton $\mathcal{M}$ over a unary alphabet.

The purpose of the new construction is, on the one hand, to show students how small automata can be constructed, without the need for empty transitions, and on the other hand to show how the construction method admits closure proofs of regular languages with respect to other operators as well. These results, while not theoretically surprising, point to an additional influence of process-algebraic research: in addition to providing fundamental insights into the nature of concurrent computation, it also sheds new light on old, well-known constructions in automata theory."

Previous work has focused on static networks with an a priori fixed message size. This approach has two shortcomings: Recent work in distributed computing is shifting towards dynamically changing communication networks rather than static ones, and an important class of distributed algorithms are so-called full-information protocols, where nodes piggy-pack previously received messages onto current messages.   In this work, we consider the synthesis problem for a system of two nodes communicating in rounds over a dynamic link whose message size is not bounded. Given a network model, i.e., a set of link directions, in each round of the execution, the adversary choses a link from the network model, restricted only by the specification, and delivers messages according to the current link's directions. Motivated by communication buses with direct acknowledge mechanisms, we further assume that nodes are aware of which messages have been delivered.   We show that the synthesis problem is decidable for a network model if and only if it does not contain the empty link that dismisses both nodes' messages."

Furthermore, we lift many results from nondeterministic parity GFG automata to alternating ones: a single exponential determinisation procedure, an Exptime upper bound to the GFGness problem, a PTime algorithm for the GFGness problem of weak automata, and a reduction from a positive solution to the $G_2$ conjecture to a PTime algorithm for the GFGness problem of parity automata with a fixed index. The $G_2$ conjecture states that a nondeterministic parity automaton A is GFG if and only if a token game, known as the $G_2$ game, played on A is won by the first player. So far, it had only been proved for B\""uchi automata; we provide further evidence for it by proving it for coB\""uchi automata.

We do so under a different perspective, that is, we consider a dynamic version of the problem, called monitoring problem, where the automaton is fixed and the input is revealed as in a stream, one symbol at a time following the natural order on positions. The goal here is to design a dynamic data structure that can be queried about whether the word consisting of symbols revealed so far is accepted by the automaton, and that can be efficiently updated when the next symbol is revealed. We provide complexity bounds for this monitoring problem, by considering timed automata that process symbols interleaved with timestamps. The main contribution is that monitoring of a one-clock timed automaton, with all its components but the clock constants fixed, can be done in amortised constant time per input symbol."

In particular, we consider the case where the players have asymmetric information about each other's action capabilities: P2 starts with an incomplete information (misperception) about P1's action set, and updates the misperception when P1 uses an action previously unknown to P2. When P1 is made aware of P2's misperception, the key question is whether P1 can control P2's perception so as to deceive P2 into selecting actions to P1's advantage? We show that there might exist a deceptive winning strategy for P1 that ensures P1's objective is achieved with probability one from a state otherwise losing for P1, had the information being symmetric and complete. We present three key results: First, we introduce a dynamic hypergame model to capture the reachability game with evolving misperception of P2. Second, we present a fixed-point algorithm to compute the Deceptive Almost-Sure Winning (DASW) region and DASW strategy. Finally, we show that DASW strategy is at least as powerful as Almost-Sure Winning (ASW) strategy in the game in which P1 does not account for P2's misperception.

Active deception in a network employs decoy systems and other defenses to conduct defensive planning against the intrusion of malicious attackers who have been confirmed by sensing systems. In this setting, the defender's objective is to ensure the satisfaction of security properties specified in temporal logic formulas. We formulate the problem of deceptive planning with decoy systems and other defenses as a two-player games with asymmetrical information and Boolean payoffs in temporal logic. We use level-2 hypergame with temporal logic objectives to capture the incomplete/incorrect knowledge of the attacker about the network system as a payoff misperception. The true payoff function is private information of the defender. Then, we extend the solution concepts of $omega$-regular games to analyze the attacker's rational strategy given her incomplete information. By generalizing the solution of level-2 hypergame in the normal form to extensive form, we extend the solutions of games with safe temporal logic objectives to decide whether the defender can ensure security properties to be satisfied with probability one, given any possible strategy that is perceived to be rational by the attacker. Further, we use the solution of games with co-safe (reachability) temporal logic objectives to determine whether the defender can engage the attacker, by directing the attacker to a high-fidelity honeypot. The effectiveness of the proposed synthesis methods is illustrated with synthetic network systems with honeypots."

To this end, we formalize the problem of equivalence between two programs as finding a set of semantics-preserving rewrite rules from one into the other, such that after the rewrite the two programs are structurally identical, and therefore trivially equivalent. We then develop the first graph-to-sequence neural network system for program equivalence, trained to produce such rewrite sequences from a carefully crafted automatic example generation algorithm. We extensively evaluate our system on a rich multi-type linear algebra expression language, using arbitrary combinations of 100+ graph-rewriting axioms of equivalence. Our system outputs via inference a correct rewrite sequence for 96% of the 10,000 program pairs isolated for testing, using 30-term programs. And in all cases, the validity of the sequence produced and therefore the provable assertion of program equivalence is computable, in negligible time."
2020-02-17 01:54:27+00:00,2020-05-12 03:44:09+00:00,"Runtime Verification (RV) is a lightweight formal technique in which program or system execution is monitored and analyzed, to check whether certain properties are satisfied or violated after a finite number of steps. The use of RV has led to interest in deciding whether a property is monitorable: whether it is always possible for the satisfaction or violation of the property to be determined after a finite future continuation. However, classical two-valued monitorability suffers from two inherent limitations. First, a property can only be evaluated as monitorable or non-monitorable; no information is available regarding whether only one verdict (satisfaction or violation) can be detected. Second, monitorability is defined at the language-level and does not tell us whether satisfaction or violation can be detected starting from the current monitor state during system execution.   To address these limitations, this paper proposes a new notion of four-valued monitorability for $\omega$-languages and applies it at the state-level. Four-valued monitorability is more informative than two-valued monitorability as a property can be evaluated as a four-valued result, denoting that only satisfaction, only violation, or both are active for a monitorable property. We can also compute state-level weak monitorability, i.e., whether satisfaction or violation can be detected starting from a given state in a monitor, which enables state-level optimizations of monitoring algorithms. Based on a new six-valued semantics, we propose procedures for computing four-valued monitorability of $\omega$-regular languages, both at the language-level and at the state-level. We have developed a new tool that implements the proposed procedure for computing monitorability of LTL formulas."

A formal contract distinguishes between assumptions, which are constraints that the designer of a component puts on the environments in which the component can be used safely, and guarantees, which are promises that the designer asks from the team that implements the component. A theory of formal contracts can be formalized as an interface theory, which supports the composition and refinement of both assumptions and guarantees. Although there is a rich landscape of contract-based design methods that address functional and extra-functional properties, we present the first interface theory that is designed for ensuring system-wide security properties, thus paving the way for a science of safety and security co-engineering. Our framework provides a refinement relation and a composition operation that support both incremental design and independent implementability. We develop our theory for both stateless and stateful interfaces. We illustrate the applicability of our framework with an example inspired from the automotive domain. Finally, we provide three plausible trace semantics to stateful information-flow interfaces and we show that only two correspond to temporal logics for specifying hyperproperties, while the third defines a new class of hyperproperties that lies between the other two classes."

This model is Turing complete, and hence, one is often interested in analyzing a restricted class that still captures useful behaviors. In this paper, we propose a new class of bounded under approximations for multi-pushdown systems, which subsumes most existing classes. We develop an efficient algorithm for solving the under-approximate reachability problem, which is based on efficient fix-point computations. We implement it in our tool BHIM and illustrate its applicability by generating a set of relevant benchmarks and examining its performance. As an additional takeaway, BHIM solves the binary reachability problem in pushdown automata. To show the versatility of our approach, we then extend our algorithm to the timed setting and provide the first implementation that can handle timed multi-pushdown automata with closed guards."

Even when just demanding an embedding into a reachability graph instead of an isomorphism, a solution is not guaranteed. In such a case, label splitting is an option, i.e. relabelling edges of the LTS such that differently labelled edges remain different. With an appropriate label splitting, we can always obtain a solution for the synthesis or embedding problem. Using the label splitting, we can construct a labelled Petri net with the intended bahaviour (e.g. embedding the given LTS in its reachability graph). As the labelled Petri net can have a large number of transitions, an optimisation may be desired, limiting the number of labels produced by the label splitting. We show that such a limitation will turn the problem from being solvable in polynomial time into an NP-complete problem."

This theory suggests, and our result proves, that small differences in the nature of adhesive bindings between abstract square molecules gives rise to vastly different expressive capabilities.   In the cooperative abstract Tile Assembly Model, square tiles attach to each other using multi-sided cooperation of one, two or more sides. This precise control of tile binding is directly exploited for algorithmic tasks including growth of specified shapes using very few tile types, as well as simulation of Turing machines and even self-simulation of self-assembly systems. But are cooperative bindings required for these computational tasks? The definitionally simpler noncooperative (or Temperature 1) model has poor control over local binding events: tiles stick if they bind on at least one side. This has led to the conjecture that it is impossible for it to exhibit precisely controlled growth of computationally-defined shapes.   Here, we prove such an impossibility result. We show that any planar noncooperative system that attempts to grow large algorithmically-controlled tile-efficient assemblies must also grow infinite non-algorithmic (pumped) structures with a simple closed-form description, or else suffer blocking of intended algorithmic structures. Our result holds for both directed and nondirected systems, and gives an explicit upper bound of $(8|T|)^{4|T|+1}(5|\sigma| + 6)$, where $|T|$ is the size of the tileset and $|\sigma|$ is the size of the seed assembly, beyond which any path of tiles is pumpable or blockable."

In this paper we prove a positive and a negative result for the emptiness problem of alternating automata with qualitative semantics.   The positive result is the decidability of the emptiness problem for the case of B\""uchi acceptance condition. An interesting aspect of our approach is that we do not extend the classical solution for solving the emptiness problem of alternating automata, which first constructs an equivalent non-deterministic automaton. Instead, we directly construct an emptiness game making use of imperfect information.   The negative result is the undecidability of the emptiness problem for the case of co-B\""uchi acceptance condition. This result has two direct consequences: the undecidability of monadic second-order logic extended with the qualitative path-measure quantifier, and the undecidability of the emptiness problem for alternating tree automata with non-zero semantics, a recently introduced probabilistic model of alternating tree automata."

Focusing on the case of base b = 2, we study the computational problem of checking whether a given number is sturdy, giving several algorithms for the problem. We find two additional, previously unknown sturdy primes. We develop a method for determining which numbers with a fixed number of 0's in binary are flimsy.

A final coalgebra then gives rise to the coinduction principle, which states that two bisimilar elements are equal. For polynomial functors, this leads to well-known descriptions. In the present paper we look at the dual notion of ""apartness"". Intuitively, two elements are apart if there is a positive way to distinguish them. Phrased differently: two elements are apart if and only if they are not bisimilar. Since apartness is an inductive notion, described by a least fixed point, we can give a proof system, to derive that two elements are apart. This proof system has derivation rules and two elements are apart if and only if there is a finite derivation (using the rules) of this fact.   We study apartness versus bisimulation in two separate ways. First, for weak forms of bisimulation on labelled transition systems, where silent (tau) steps are included, we define an apartness notion that corresponds to weak bisimulation and another apartness that corresponds to branching bisimulation. The rules for apartness can be used to show that two states of a labelled transition system are not branching bismilar. To support the apartness view on labelled transition systems, we cast a number of well-known properties of branching bisimulation in terms of branching apartness and prove them. Next, we also study the more general categorical situation and show that indeed, apartness is the dual of bisimilarity in a precise categorical sense: apartness is an initial algebra and gives rise to an induction principle. In this analogy, we include the powerset functor, which gives a semantics to non-deterministic choice in process-theory."

The standard makes available a set of diagrams to represent such perspectives. Choreography diagrams represent global constraints concerning the interactions among system components without exposing their internal structure. Collaboration diagrams instead permit to depict the internal behaviour of a component, also referred as process, when integrated with others so to represent a possible implementation of the distributed system.   This paper proposes a design methodology and a formal framework for checking conformance of choreographies against collaborations. In particular, the paper presents a direct formal operational semantics for both BPMN choreography and collaboration diagrams. Conformance aspects are proposed through two relations defined on top of the defined semantics. The approach benefits from the availability of a tool we have developed, named C4, that permits to experiment the theoretical framework in practical contexts. The objective here is to make the exploited formal methods transparent to system designers, thus fostering a wider adoption by practitioners."

We provide an algorithm generating the $2$-binomial equivalence class of a word. For $k \geq 2$ and alphabet of $3$ or more symbols, the language made of lexicographically least elements of every $k$-binomial equivalence class and the language of singletons, i.e., the words whose $k$-binomial equivalence class is restricted to a single element, are shown to be non context-free.

Our contributions are the following. For non-Boolean alphabets and for any network size, there are intrinsically non-sequential transformations (i.e. that can not be obtained as composition of sequential updates of some network). Moreover there is no universal automaton network that can produce all non-bijective functions via compositions of asynchronous updates.

Our main results include: 1) SRT are closed under union and intersection, and add-free SRT are also closed under composition; 2) SRT-definable transformations can be defined in monadic second-order (MSO) logic, but are not comparable with first-order (FO) definable transformations; 3) the functionality problem is decidable for add-free SRT, the reactivity problem and inclusion problem are decidable for deterministic add-free SRT, but none of these problems is decidable in general for SRT."

Much research went into devising ad hoc adaptations of algorithms for different types of automata. The CALF project seeks to unify these using category theory in order to ease correctness proofs and guide the design of new algorithms. In this paper, we extend CALF to cover learning of algebraic structures that may not have a coalgebraic presentation. Furthermore, we provide a detailed algorithmic account of an abstract version of the popular L* algorithm, which was missing from CALF. We instantiate the abstract theory to a large class of Set functors, by which we recover for the first time practical tree automata learning algorithms from an abstract framework and at the same time obtain new algorithms to learn algebras of quotiented polynomial functors."
2020-01-15 22:31:57+00:00,2020-01-15 22:31:57+00:00,"It can be shown that each permutation group $G \sqsubseteq S_n$ can be embedded, in a well defined sense, in a connected graph with $O(n+|G|)$ vertices. Some groups, however, require much fewer vertices. For instance, $S_n$ itself can be embedded in the $n$-clique $K_n$, a connected graph with n vertices. In this work, we show that the minimum size of a context-free grammar generating a finite permutation group $G \sqsubseteq S_n$ can be upper bounded by three structural parameters of connected graphs embedding $G$: the number of vertices, the treewidth, and the maximum degree. More precisely, we show that any permutation group $G \sqsubseteq S_n$ that can be embedded into a connected graph with $m$ vertices, treewidth k, and maximum degree $\Delta$, can also be generated by a context-free grammar of size $2^{O(k\Delta\log\Delta)}\cdot m^{O(k)}$. By combining our upper bound with a connection between the extension complexity of a permutation group and the grammar complexity of a formal language, we also get that these permutation groups can be represented by polytopes of extension complexity $2^{O(k \Delta\log \Delta)}\cdot m^{O(k)}$. The above upper bounds can be used to provide trade-offs between the index of permutation groups, and the number of vertices, treewidth and maximum degree of connected graphs embedding these groups. In particular, by combining our main result with a celebrated $2^{\Omega(n)}$ lower bound on the grammar complexity of the symmetric group $S_n$ we have that connected graphs of treewidth $o(n/\log n)$ and maximum degree $o(n/\log n)$ embedding subgroups of $S_n$ of index $2^{cn}$ for some small constant $c$ must have $n^{\omega(1)}$ vertices. This lower bound can be improved to exponential on graphs of treewidth $n^{\varepsilon}$ for $\varepsilon<1$ and maximum degree $o(n/\log n)$."

Adiabatic evolution of quantum systems have been studied as a potential means that physically realizes quantum computation. Up to now, all the research on adiabatic quantum systems has dealt with polynomial time-bounded computation and little attention has been paid to, for instance, adiabatic quantum systems consuming only constant memory space. Such quantum systems can be modeled in a form similar to quantum finite automata. This exposition dares to ask a bold question of how to make adiabatic quantum computation fit into the rapidly progressing framework of quantum automata theory. As our answer to this eminent but profound question, we first lay out a fundamental platform to carry out adiabatic evolutionary quantum systems (AEQSs) with limited computational resources (in size, energy, spectral gap, etc.) and then establish how to construct such AEQSs by operating suitable families of quantum finite automata. We further explore fundamental structural properties of decision problems (as well as promise problems) solved quickly by the appropriately constructed AEQSs."

Our main results are that $\omega$-GFG-PDA are more expressive than deterministic $\omega$- pushdown automata and that solving infinite games with winning conditions specified by $\omega$-GFG-PDA is EXPTIME-complete. Thus, we have identified a new class of $\omega$-contextfree winning conditions for which solving games is decidable. It follows that the universality problem for $\omega$-GFG-PDA is in EXPTIME as well. Moreover, we study closure properties of the class of languages recognized by $\omega$-GFG- PDA and decidability of good-for-gameness of $\omega$-pushdown automata and languages.

We further improve the understanding and utility of decisiveness in two ways. First, we provide a general criterion for proving decisiveness of general STSs. This criterion, which is very natural but whose proof is rather technical, (strictly) generalizes all known criteria from the literature. Second, we focus on stochastic hybrid systems (SHSs), a stochastic extension of hybrid systems. We establish the decisiveness of a large class of SHSs and, under a few classical hypotheses from mathematical logic, we show how to decide reachability problems in this class, even though they are undecidable for general SHSs.

The central concepts studied and exploited are attractor decompositions of dominia in parity games and the ordered trees that describe the inductive structure of attractor decompositions.   The main technical results include the embeddable decomposition theorem and the dominion separation theorem that together help establish a precise structural condition for the correctness of the universal algorithm: it suffices that the two ordered trees given to the algorithm as inputs embed the trees of some attractor decompositions of the largest dominia for each of the two players, respectively.   The universal algorithm yields McNaughton-Zielonka, Parys's, and Lehtinen-Schewe-Wojtczak algorithms as special cases when suitable universal trees are given to it as inputs. The main technical results provide a unified proof of correctness and deep structural insights into those algorithms.

Reachability for VASS is also inter-reducible with a plethora of problems from a number of areas of computer science. In spite of recent progress, the complexity of the reachability problem remains unsettled, and it is closely related to the lengths of shortest VASS runs that witness reachability.   We consider VASS of fixed dimension, and obtain three main results. For the first two, we assume that the integers in the input are given in unary, and that the control graph of the given VASS is flat (i.e., without nested cycles). We obtain a family of VASS in dimension 3 whose shortest reachability witnessing runs are exponential, and we show that the reachability problem is NP-hard in dimension 7. These results resolve negatively questions that had been posed by the works of Blondin et al. in LICS 2015 and Englert et al. in LICS 2016, and contribute a first construction that distinguishes 3-dimensional flat VASS from 2-dimensional VASS.   Our third result, by means of a novel family of products of integer fractions, shows that 4-dimensional VASS can have doubly exponentially long shortest reachability witnessing runs.

A notorious one is controller synthesis, which can be rephrased through the game-theoretic metaphor as the quest for a winning strategy of the system in a game against its antagonistic environment. Depending on the specification, optimal strategies might be simple or quite complex, for example having to use (possibly infinite) memory. Hence, research strives to understand which settings allow for simple strategies.   In 2005, Gimbert and Zielonka provided a complete characterization of preference relations (a formal framework to model specifications and game objectives) that admit memoryless optimal strategies for both players. In the last fifteen years however, practical applications have driven the community toward games with complex or multiple objectives, where memory -- finite or infinite -- is almost always required. Despite much effort, the exact frontiers of the class of preference relations that admit finite-memory optimal strategies still elude us.   In this work, we establish a complete characterization of preference relations that admit optimal strategies using arena-independent finite memory, generalizing the work of Gimbert and Zielonka to the finite-memory case. We also prove an equivalent to their celebrated corollary of great practical interest: if both players have optimal (arena-independent-)finite-memory strategies in all one-player games, then it is also the case in all two-player games. Finally, we pinpoint the boundaries of our results with regard to the literature: our work completely covers the case of arena-independent memory (e.g., multiple parity objectives, lower- and upper-bounded energy objectives), and paves the way to the arena-dependent case (e.g., multiple lower-bounded energy objectives)."

In this thesis, we focus on two such models, namely the finite automata over groups and the homing vector automata.   A finite automaton over a group $ G $ is a nondeterministic finite automaton equipped with a register that holds an element of the group $ G $. The register is initialized to the identity element of the group and a computation is successful if the register is equal to the identity element at the end of the computation after being multiplied with a group element at every step. We investigate the language recognition power of finite automata over integer and rational matrix groups and reveal new relationships between the language classes corresponding to these models. We examine the effect of various parameters on the language recognition power. We establish a link between the decision problems of matrix semigroups and the corresponding automata. We present some new results about valence pushdown automata and context-free valence grammars.   We also propose the new homing vector automaton model, which is a finite automaton equipped with a vector that can be multiplied with a matrix at each step. The vector can be checked for equivalence to the initial vector and the acceptance criterion is ending up in an accept state with the value of the vector being equal to the initial vector. We examine the effect of various restrictions on the model by confining the matrices to a particular set and allowing the equivalence test only at the end of the computation. We define the different variants of the model and compare their language recognition power with that of the classical models."

The first, which we call stochastic fairness, is classical, and assumes an environment which operates probabilistically using possibly unknown probabilities. The second, which is language-theoretic, assumes that if an action is taken from a given state infinitely often then all its possible outcomes should appear infinitely often (we call this state-action fairness). While the two notions coincide for standard reachability goals, they diverge for temporally extended goals. This important difference has been overlooked in the planning literature, and we argue has led to confusion in a number of published algorithms which use reductions that were stated for state-action fairness, for which they are incorrect, while being correct for stochastic fairness. We remedy this and provide an optimal sound and complete algorithm for solving state-action fair planning for LTL/LTLf goals, as well as a correct proof of the lower bound of the goal-complexity (our proof is general enough that it provides new proofs also for the no-fairness and stochastic-fairness cases). Overall, we show that stochastic fairness is better behaved than state-action fairness."

We then look at alternating automata as introduced by Chandra, Kozen and Stockmeyer: such machines run independent computations on the word and gather their answers through boolean combinations. We devise a lower bound technique relying on boundedly generated lattices of languages, and give two applications of this technique. The first is a hierarchy theorem, stating that there are languages of arbitrarily high polynomial alternating state complexity, and the second is a linear lower bound on the alternating state complexity of the prime numbers written in binary.

The evaluation complexity of CXRPQs, if not further restricted, is PSPACE-hard in data-complexity. We identify three natural fragments with more acceptable evaluation complexity: their data-complexity is in NL, while their combined complexity varies between EXPSPACE, PSPACE and NP. In terms of expressive power, we compare the CXRPQ-fragments with CRPQs and unions of CRPQs, and with extended conjunctive regular path queries (ECRPQs) and unions of ECRPQs."

The workshop was held in Eindhoven, The Netherlands, on July 17th, 2019, as part of STAF 2019 (Software Technologies: Applications and Foundations).   Graphs are common mathematical structures that are visual and intuitive. They constitute a natural and seamless way for system modelling in science, engineering and beyond, including computer science, biology, business process modelling, etc. Graph computation models constitute a class of very high-level models where graphs are first-class citizens. The aim of the International GCM Workshop series is to bring together researchers interested in all aspects of computation models based on graphs and graph transformation. It promotes the cross-fertilizing exchange of ideas and experiences among senior and young researchers from the different communities interested in the foundations, applications, and implementations of graph computation models and related areas.   These post-proceedings contain four selected papers from GCM2019 proceedings and an invited presentation that gives an account of the very successful panel discussion dedicated to the Analysis of Graph Transformation Systems, which took place during the workshop and was animated by Reiko Heckel, Leen Lambers and Maryam Ghaffari Saadat.   All submissions were subject to careful refereeing. The topics of accepted papers include theoretical aspects of graph transformation and parsing techniques as well as an application to model-driven engineering."

We introduce a distance between timed words, the {\em timed edit distance}, which generalizes the classical edit distance. A timed word $x$ is $\epsilon$-far from a timed language if its relative distance to the language is greater than $\epsilon$."

In this article, we investigate the computational power of programs over monoids in $\mathbf{J}$, a small variety of finite aperiodic monoids. First, we give a fine hierarchy within the class of languages recognised by programs over monoids from $\mathbf{J}$, based on the length of programs but also some parametrisation of $\mathbf{J}$. Second, and most importantly, we make progress in understanding what regular languages can be recognised by programs over monoids in $\mathbf{J}$. To this end, we introduce a new class of restricted dot-depth one languages, threshold dot-depth one languages. We show that programs over monoids in $\mathbf{J}$ actually can recognise all languages from this class, using a non-trivial trick, and conjecture that threshold dot-depth one languages with additional positional modular counting suffice to characterise the regular languages recognised by programs over monoids in $\mathbf{J}$. Finally, using a result by J. C. Costa, we give an algebraic characterisation of threshold dot-depth one languages that supports that conjecture and is of independent interest."
2019-12-17 04:54:05+00:00,2019-12-17 04:54:05+00:00,"We present Prema, a tool for Precise Requirement Editing, Modeling and Analysis. It can be used in various fields for describing precise requirements using formal notations and performing rigorous analysis. By parsing the requirements written in formal modeling language, Prema is able to get a model which aptly depicts the requirements. It also provides different rigorous verification and validation techniques to check whether the requirements meet users' expectation and find potential errors. We show that our tool can provide a unified environment for writing and verifying requirements without using tools that are not well inter-related. For experimental demonstration, we use the requirements of the automatic train protection (ATP) system of CASCO signal co. LTD., the largest railway signal control system manufacturer of China.

A key observation here is that even if we consider systems with LTLf goals on finite traces, environment assumptions need to be expressed over infinite traces, since accomplishing the agent goals may require an unbounded number of environment action. To solve synthesis with respect to finite-trace LTLf goals under infinite-trace assumptions, we could reduce the problem to LTL synthesis. Unfortunately, while synthesis in LTLf and in LTL have the same worst-case complexity (both 2EXPTIME-complete), the algorithms available for LTL synthesis are much more difficult in practice than those for LTLf synthesis. In this work we show that in interesting cases we can avoid such a detour to LTL synthesis and keep the simplicity of LTLf synthesis. Specifically, we develop a BDD-based fixpoint-based technique for handling basic forms of fairness and of stability assumptions. We show, empirically, that this technique performs much better than standard LTL synthesis."

Verification of opacity for discrete-event systems modeled by automata is in general a hard problem. We discuss the question whether there are structural restrictions on the system models for which the opacity verification is tractable. We consider two kinds of automata models: (i) acyclic automata, and (ii) automata where all cycles are only in the form of self-loops. In some sense, these models are the simplest models of (deadlock-free) systems. Although the expressivity of such systems is weaker than the expressivity of linear temporal logic, we show that the opacity verification for these systems is still hard."

It asks whether the current and subsequent states of a system can be determined based on observations. Since, in some applications, to exactly determine the current and subsequent states may be too strict, a relaxed notion of D-detectability has been introduced, distinguishing only certain pairs of states rather than all states. Four variants of D-detectability have been defined: strong (periodic) D-detectability and weak (periodic) D-detectability. Deciding weak (periodic) D-detectability is PSpace-complete, while deciding strong (periodic) detectability or strong D-detectability is polynomial (and we show that it is actually NL-complete). However, to the best of our knowledge, it is an open problem whether there exists a polynomial-time algorithm deciding strong periodic D-detectability. We solve this problem by showing that deciding strong periodic D-detectability is a PSpace-complete problem, and hence there is no polynomial-time algorithm unless PSpace = P. We further show that there is no polynomial-time algorithm deciding strong periodic D-detectability even for systems with a single observable event, unless P = NP. Finally, we propose a class of systems for which the problem is tractable."

2019-12-12 18:18:55+00:00,2021-05-13 16:38:17+00:00,"We propose FC, a new logic on words that combines finite model theory with the theory of concatenation - a first-order logic that is based on word equations. Like the theory of concatenation, FC is built around word equations; in contrast to it, its semantics are defined to only allow finite models, by limiting the universe to a word and all its factors. As a consequence of this, FC has many of the desirable properties of FO on finite models, while being far more expressive than FO[<]. Most noteworthy among these desirable properties are sufficient criteria for efficient model checking, and capturing various complexity classes by adding operators for transitive closures or fixed points.   Not only does FC allow us to obtain new insights and techniques for expressive power and efficient evaluation of document spanners, but it also provides a general framework for logic on words that also has potential applications in other areas."

The main aim to develop mechanical reasoning systems (also known as theorem provers) was to enable mathematicians to prove theorems by computer programs. However, these tools evolved with time and now play vital role in the modeling and reasoning about complex and large-scale systems, especially safety-critical systems. Technically, mathematical formalisms and automated reasoning based-approaches are employed to perform inferences and to generate proofs in theorem provers. In literature, there is a shortage of comprehensive documents that can provide proper guidance about the preferences of theorem provers with respect to their designs, performances, logical frameworks, strengths, differences and their application areas. In this work, more than 40 theorem provers are studied in detail and compared to present a comprehensive analysis and evaluation of these tools. Theorem provers are investigated based on various parameters, which includes: implementation architecture, logic and calculus used, library support, level of automation, programming paradigm, programming language, differences and application areas."

There are wta for which these semantics are different; however, for bottom-up deterministic wta and for wta over semirings, the difference vanishes. A wta is crisp-deterministic if it is bottom-up deterministic and each transition is weighted by one of the unit elements of the strong bimonoid. We prove that the class of weighted tree languages recognized by crisp-deterministic wta is the same as the class of recognizable step mappings. Moreover, we investigate the following two crisp-determinization problems: for a given wta ${\cal A}$, (a) is there a crisp-deterministic wta which computes the initial algebra semantics of ${\cal A}$ and (b) is there a crisp-deterministic wta which computes the run semantics of ${\cal A}$? We show that the finiteness of the Nerode algebra ${\cal N}({\cal A})$ of ${\cal A}$ implies a positive answer for (a), and that the finite order property of ${\cal A}$ implies a positive answer for (b). We show a sufficient condition which guarantees the finiteness of ${\cal N}({\cal A})$ and a sufficient condition which guarantees the finite order property of ${\cal A}$. Also, we provide an algorithm for the construction of the crisp-deterministic wta according to (a) if ${\cal N}({\cal A})$ is finite, and similarly for (b) if ${\cal A}$ has finite order property. We prove that it is undecidable whether an arbitrary wta ${\cal A}$ is crisp-determinizable. We also prove that both, the finiteness of ${\cal N}({\cal A})$ and the finite order property of ${\cal A}$ are undecidable."

We specialise the parsing with derivatives algorithm to LL(1) context-free expressions, where alternatives can be chosen given a single token of lookahead. We formalise the notion of LL(1) expressions and show how to efficiently check the LL(1) property. Next, we present a novel linear-time parsing with derivatives algorithm for LL(1) expressions operating on a zipper-inspired data structure.

The use of models to analyse the underlying processes is a well-known practice. However, due to the complexity and continuous evolution of their processes, organizations need an effective way of analysing the relation between processes and models. Conformance checking techniques asses the suitability of a process model in representing an underlying process, observed through a collection of real executions. One important metric in conformance checking is to asses the precision of the model with respect to the observed executions, i.e., characterize the ability of the model to produce behavior unrelated to the one observed. In this paper we present the notion of anti-alignment as a concept to help unveiling runs in the model that may deviate significantly from the observed behavior. Using anti-alignments, a new metric for precision is proposed. In contrast to existing metrics, anti-alignment based precision metrics satisfy most of the required axioms highlighted in a recent publication. Moreover, a complexity analysis of the problem of computing anti-alignments is provided, which sheds light into the practicability of using anti-alignment to estimate precision. Experiments are provided that witness the validity of the concepts introduced in this paper."

In this work, we extend the scope of existing synthesis methods to hyper-temporal logics. We are motivated by the fact that important planning objectives, such as optimality, robustness, and privacy, (maybe implicitly) involve the interrelation between multiple paths. Such objectives are thus hyperproperties, and cannot be expressed with usual temporal logics like the linear temporal logic (LTL). We show that such hyperproperties can be expressed by HyperLTL, an extension of LTL to multiple paths. To handle the complexity of planning with HyperLTL specifications, we introduce a symbolic approach for synthesizing planning strategies on discrete transition systems. Our planning method is evaluated on several case studies."

We prove a Pumping Lemma for $DRec_L$ from which several decidability results follow. The closure properties of $DRec_L$ under various operations are established. We also characterize DT-recognizability in terms of L-fuzzy path languages, and prove that the path closure of any regular L-fuzzy tree language is DT-recognizable, and that it is decidable whether a regular L-fuzzy tree language is DT-recognizable. In most of the paper, L is just any nontrivial bounded lattice, but sometimes it is assumed to be distributive or even a bounded chain."

Asymmetric choice (AC) extends EFC such that two places may also have postsets where one is contained in the other. In reduced AC nets this containment is limited: If the postsets are neither disjoint nor equal, one is a singleton and the other has exactly two transitions. The aim of Petri net synthesis is to find an unlabelled Petri net in some target class with a reachability graph isomorphic to a given finite labelled transition system (lts). Choice-free nets have strong properties, allowing to often easily detect when synthesis will fail or at least to quicken the synthesis. With EFC as the target class, only few properties can be checked ahead and there seem to be no short cuts lowering the complexity of the synthesis (compared to arbitrary Petri nets). For AC nets no synthesis procedure is known at all. We show here how synthesis to a superclass of reduced AC nets (not containing the full AC net class) can be done."
2019-11-19 08:05:24+00:00,2020-02-17 20:16:37+00:00,"LTLf synthesis is the automated construction of a reactive system from a high-level description, expressed in LTLf, of its finite-horizon behavior. So far, the conversion of LTLf formulas to deterministic finite-state automata (DFAs) has been identified as the primary bottleneck to the scalabity of synthesis. Recent investigations have also shown that the size of the DFA state space plays a critical role in synthesis as well.   Therefore, effective resolution of the bottleneck for synthesis requires the conversion to be time and memory performant, and prevent state-space explosion. Current conversion approaches, however, which are based either on explicit-state representation or symbolic-state representation, fail to address these necessities adequately at scale: Explicit-state approaches generate minimal DFA but are slow due to expensive DFA minimization. Symbolic-state representations can be succinct, but due to the lack of DFA minimization they generate such large state spaces that even their symbolic representations cannot compensate for the blow-up.   This work proposes a hybrid representation approach for the conversion. Our approach utilizes both explicit and symbolic representations of the state-space, and effectively leverages their complementary strengths. In doing so, we offer an LTLf to DFA conversion technique that addresses all three necessities, hence resolving the bottleneck. A comprehensive empirical evaluation on conversion and synthesis benchmarks supports the merits of our hybrid approach."

A flexible, automaton-based refinement scheme, generalizing existing refinement methods, guarantees that the associated security property is preserved by a program transformation. In practice, the refinement relations (""security witnesses"") can be generated during compilation and validated independently with a refinement checker. This process is illustrated for common optimizations. Crucially, it is not necessary to verify the compiler implementation itself, which is infeasible in practice for production compilers."

However, requiring up front unambiguous grammars can force language designers to make more or less arbitrary choices to disambiguate the language. In this paper, we depart from the traditional view of unambiguous grammar design, and enable the detection of ambiguities to be delayed until parse time, allowing the user of the language to perform the disambiguation. A natural decision problem follows: given a language definition, can a user always disambiguate an ambiguous program? We introduce and formalize this fundamental problem - called the resolvable ambiguity problem - and divide it into separate static and dynamic resolvability problems. We provide solutions to the static problem for a restricted language class and sketch proofs of soundness and completeness. We also provide a sound and complete solution to the dynamic problem for a much less restricted class of languages. The approach is evaluated through two separate case studies, covering both a large existing programming language, and the composability of domain-specific languages."

Traditionally, reactive synthesis has been applied to the construction of a stateful hardware circuit. This work is motivated by applications to other domains, such as the IoT (the Internet of Things) and robotics, where it is necessary to coordinate the actions of multiple sensors, devices, and robots. The mathematical model represents such entities as individual processes in Hoare's CSP model. Given a network of interacting entities, called an \emph{environment}, and a temporal specification of long-term behavior, the synthesis method constructs a \emph{coordinator} process (if one exists) that guides the actions of the environment entities so that the combined system is deadlock-free and satisfies the given specification. The main technical challenge is that a coordinator may have only \emph{partial knowledge} of the environment state, due to non-determinism within the environment, and environment actions that are hidden from the coordinator. This is the first method to handle both sources of partial knowledge, and to do so for arbitrary linear temporal logic specifications. It is shown that the coordination synthesis problem is \PSPACE-hard in the size of the environment. A prototype implementation is able to synthesize compact solutions for a number of coordination problems."
2019-11-09 04:51:29+00:00,2019-11-09 04:51:29+00:00,"In this dissertation, we study two of the global properties of 1-dimensional cellular automata (CAs) under periodic boundary condition, namely, reversibility and randomness. To address reversibility of finite CAs, we develop a mathematical tool, named reachability tree, which can efficiently characterize those CAs. A decision algorithm is proposed using minimized reachability tree which takes a CA rule and size n as input and verifies whether the CA is reversible for that n. To decide reversibility of a finite CA, we need to know both the rule and the CA size. However, for infinite CAs, reversibility is decided based on the local rule only. Therefore, apparently, these two cases seem to be divergent. This dissertation targets to construct a bridge between these two cases. To do so, reversibility of CAs is redefined and the notion of semi-reversible CAs is introduced. Hence, we propose a new classification of finite CAs -(1) reversible CAs, (2) semi-reversible CAs and (3) strictly irreversible CAs. Finally, relation between reversibility of finite and infinite CAs is established. This dissertation also explores CAs as source of randomness and build pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) based on CAs. We identify a list of properties for a CA to be a good source of randomness. Two heuristic algorithms are proposed to synthesize candidate (decimal) CAs which have great potentiality as PRNGs. Two schemes tare developed o use these CAs as window-based PRNGs - (1) as decimal number generators and as (2) binary number generators. We empirically observe that in comparison to the best PRNG SFMT19937-64, average performance of our proposed PRNGs are slightly better. Hence, our decimal CAs based PRNGs are one of the best PRNGs today."

Based on an algebraic characterization by Boja\'nczyk, et. al.,(2012) in terms of forest algebras, Straubing (2013) described an approach to PDL based on a k-fold iterated distributive law. A proof that all languages satisfying such a k-fold iterated distributive law are in PDL would settle decidability of PDL. We solve this problem in the case k=2: All languages recognized by forest algebras satisfying a 2-fold iterated distributive law are in PDL. Furthermore, we show that this class is decidable. This provides a novel nontrivial decidable subclass of PDL, and demonstrates the viability of the proposed approach to deciding PDL in general."

Most requirements are written in natural language, good for understandability but lacking in precision. To make requirements precise, researchers have for years advocated the use of mathematics-based notations and methods, known as ""formal"". Many exist, differing in their style, scope and applicability. The present survey discusses some of the main formal approaches and compares them to informal methods. The analysis uses a set of 9 complementary criteria, such as level of abstraction, tool availability, traceability support. It classifies the approaches into five categories: general-purpose, natural-language, graph/automata, other mathematical notations, seamless (programming-language-based). It presents approaches in all of these categories, altogether 22 different ones, including for example SysML, Relax, Eiffel, Event-B, Alloy. The review discusses a number of open questions, including seamlessness, the role of tools and education, and how to make industrial applications benefit more from the contributions of formal approaches.   (This is the full version of the survey, including some sections and two appendices which, because of length restrictions, do not appear in the submitted version.)"

This class of problems captures the design and analysis of a wide variety of autonomous and cyber-physical systems defined by nonlinear and black-box modules. In order to solve these problems, one has to maximize certain probabilistic objective functions overall choices of initial states and parameters. In this paper, we identify the assumptions that make it possible to view this problem as a multi-armed bandit problem. Based on this fresh perspective, we propose an algorithm (HOO-MB) for solving the problem that carefully instantiates an existing bandit algorithm -- Hierarchical Optimistic Optimization -- with appropriate parameters. As a consequence, we obtain theoretical regret bounds on sample efficiency of our solution that depends on key problem parameters like smoothness, near-optimality dimension, and batch size. The batch size parameter enables us to strike a balance between the sample efficiency and the memory usage of the algorithm. Our experiments, using the tool HooVer, suggest that the approach scales to realistic-sized problems and is often more sample-efficient compared to PlasmaLab -- a leading tool for verification of stochastic systems. Specifically, HooVer has distinct advantages in analyzing models in which the objective function has sharp slopes. In addition, HooVer shows promising behavior in parameter synthesis for a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) example."

In this paper, we show that the stochastic control problem is decidable.

Our approach is parametric in a monad T that represents the given type of languages and their recognizing algebraic structures. Using the concept of anautomata presentation of T-algebras, we demonstrate that the task of learning a T-recognizable language can be reduced to learning an abstract form of algebraic automaton whose transitions are modeled by a functor. For the important case of adjoint automata, we devise a learning algorithm generalizing Angluin's L*. The algorithm is phrased in terms of categorically described extension steps; we provide for a termination and complexity analysis based on a dedicated notion of finiteness. Our framework applies to structures like omega-regular languages that were not within the scope of existing categorical accounts of automata learning. In addition, it yields new learning algorithms for several types of languages for which no such algorithms were previously known at all, including sorted languages, nominal languages with name binding, and cost functions."

In this paper we state new properties of both Lyndon and inverse Lyndon factorizations of a word $w$, with the aim of exploring their use in some classical queries on $w$.   The main property we prove is related to a classical query on words. We prove that there are relations between the length of the longest common extension (or longest common prefix) $lcp(x,y)$ of two different suffixes $x,y$ of a word $w$ and the maximum length $\mathcal{M}$ of two consecutive factors of the inverse Lyndon factorization of $w$. More precisely, $\mathcal{M}$ is an upper bound on the length of $lcp(x,y)$. This result is in some sense stronger than the compatibility property, proved by Mantaci, Restivo, Rosone and Sciortino for the Lyndon factorization and here for the inverse Lyndon factorization. Roughly, the compatibility property allows us to extend the mutual order between local suffixes of (inverse) Lyndon factors to the suffixes of the whole word.   A main tool used in the proof of the above results is a property that we state for factors $m_i$ with nonempty borders in an inverse Lyndon factorization: a nonempty border of $m_i$ cannot be a prefix of the next factor $m_{i+1}$. The last property we prove shows that if two words share a common overlap, then their Lyndon factorizations can be used to capture the common overlap of the two words.   The above results open to the study of new applications of Lyndon words and inverse Lyndon words in the field of string comparison."

Symmetry transformations map solutions and to other solutions. We show that this property can be used to transform cached reachsets to compute new reachsets, for hybrid and multi-agent models. We develop a notion of virtual system which define symmetry transformations for a broad class of agent models that visit waypoint sequences. Using this notion of virtual system, we present a prototype tool CacheReach that builds a cache of reachtubes for this system, in a way that is agnostic of the representation of the reachsets and the reachability analysis subroutine used. Our experimental evaluation of CacheReach shows up to 66% savings in safety verification computation time on multi-agent systems with 3-dimensional linear and 4-dimensional nonlinear fixed-wing aircraft models following sequences of waypoints. These savings and our theoretical results illustrate the potential benefits of using symmetry-based caching in the safety verification of multi-agent systems."

Because neural networks are opaque, certifying their correctness is a significant challenge. To address this issue, several neural network verification approaches have recently been proposed. However, these approaches afford limited scalability, and applying them to large networks can be challenging. In this paper, we propose a framework that can enhance neural network verification techniques by using over-approximation to reduce the size of the network - thus making it more amenable to verification. We perform the approximation such that if the property holds for the smaller (abstract) network, it holds for the original as well. The over-approximation may be too coarse, in which case the underlying verification tool might return a spurious counterexample. Under such conditions, we perform counterexample-guided refinement to adjust the approximation, and then repeat the process. Our approach is orthogonal to, and can be integrated with, many existing verification techniques. For evaluation purposes, we integrate it with the recently proposed Marabou framework, and observe a significant improvement in Marabou's performance. Our experiments demonstrate the great potential of our approach for verifying larger neural networks."

In this paper, we extend these works by providing new conditions for the synthesis of Weighted Marked Graphs (WMGs), a well-known and useful class of weighted Petri nets in which each place has at most one input and one output. Some of these new conditions do not restrict the number of labels; the other ones consider up to 3 labels. Additional constraints are investigated: when the LTS is either finite or infinite, and either cyclic or acyclic. We show that one of these conditions, developed for 3 labels, does not extend to 4 nor to 5 labels. Also, we tackle geometrically the WMG-solvability of finite, acyclic LTS with any number of labels."

As in the classical case due to Church, the system selects actions depending on the program run so far, with the aim of fulfilling a given specification. The difficulty is that, at the same time, the environment executes actions that the system cannot control. In contrast to the case of fixed, finite alphabets, here we consider the case of parameterized alphabets. An alphabet reflects the number of processes that are static but unknown. The synthesis problem then asks whether there is a finite number of processes for which the system can satisfy the specification. This variant is already undecidable for very limited logics. Therefore, we consider a first-order logic without the order on word positions. We show that even in this restricted case synthesis is undecidable if both the system and the environment have access to all processes. On the other hand, we prove that the problem is decidable if the environment only has access to a bounded number of processes. In that case, there is even a cutoff meaning that it is enough to examine a bounded number of process architectures to solve the synthesis problem."

The algorithm is a variant of the exact-learning algorithm L*, adapted to a probabilistic setting with noise. The key insight is the use of conditional probabilities for observations, and the introduction of a local tolerance when comparing them. When applied to RNNs, our algorithm often achieves better word error rate (WER) and normalised distributed cumulative gain (NDCG) than that achieved by spectral extraction of weighted finite automata (WFA) from the same networks. PDFAs are substantially more expressive than n-grams, and are guaranteed to be stochastic and deterministic - unlike spectrally extracted WFAs."

In this paper we use the Kullback-Leibler divergence to formulate the $\textit{lower asymptotic divergence}$ $\text{div}(S||\alpha)$ of a probability measure $\alpha$ on $\Sigma$ from a sequence $S$ over $\Sigma$ and the $\textit{upper asymptotic divergence}$ $\text{Div}(S||\alpha)$ of $\alpha$ from $S$ in such a way that a sequence $S$ is $\alpha$-normal (meaning that every string $w$ has asymptotic frequency $\alpha(w)$ in $S$) if and only if $\text{Div}(S||\alpha)=0$. We also use the Kullback-Leibler divergence to quantify the $\textit{total risk }$ $\text{Risk}_G(w)$ that a finite-state gambler $G$ takes when betting along a prefix $w$ of $S$.   Our main theorem is a $\textit{strong dichotomy theorem}$ that uses the above notions to $\textit{quantify}$ the exponential rates of winning and losing on the two sides of the Schnorr-Stimm dichotomy theorem (with the latter routinely extended from normality to $\alpha$-normality). Modulo asymptotic caveats in the paper, our strong dichotomy theorem says that the following two things hold for prefixes $w$ of $S$.   (1) The infinitely-often exponential rate of winning is $2^{\text{Div}(S||\alpha)|w|}$.   (2) The exponential rate of loss is $2^{-\text{Risk}_G(w)}$.   We also use (1) to show that $1-\text{Div}(S||\alpha)/c$, where $c= \log(1/ \min_{a\in\Sigma}\alpha(a))$, is an upper bound on the finite-state $\alpha$-dimension of $S$ and prove the dual fact that $1-\text{div}(S||\alpha)/c$ is an upper bound on the finite-state strong $\alpha$-dimension of $S$."

For safety-critical systems such as autonomous vehicles, it can be problematic to use controllers learned from data because they cannot be guaranteed to be collision-free. Recently, a method has been proposed for learning a multi-mode hybrid automaton cruise controller (MOHA). Besides being accurate, the logical nature of this model makes it suitable for formal verification. In this paper, we demonstrate this capability using the SpaceEx hybrid model checker as follows. After learning, we translate the automaton model into constraints and equations required by SpaceEx. We then verify that a pure MOHA controller is not collision-free. By adding a safety state based on headway in time, a rule that human drivers should follow anyway, we do obtain a provably safe cruise control. Moreover, the safe controller remains more human-like than existing cruise controllers."

This question was left open in previous work, and is particularly challenging for languages recognised by nondeterministic automata. To answer it, we develop the theory of residual register automata, a subclass of nondeterministic register automata. We prove that this class has canonical representatives, which can always be constructed via a finite number of observations. This property enables active learning algorithms, and makes up for the fact that residuality - a semantic property - is undecidable for register automata. Our construction for canonical residual automata is based on a machine-independent characterisation of residual languages, for which we develop new results in nominal lattice theory. Studying residuality in the context of nominal languages is a step towards a better understanding of learnability of automata with some sort of nondeterminism."

Good examples are the close relationship between inhibitor event structures and inhibitor occurrence nets, or between asymmetric event structures and asymmetric occurrence nets. Several forms of event structures suited for the modelling of reversible computation have recently been developed; also a method for reversing occurrence nets has been proposed. This paper bridges the gap between reversible event structures and reversible nets. We introduce the notion of reversible causal net, which is a generalisation of the notion of reversible unfolding. We show that reversible causal nets correspond precisely to a subclass of reversible prime event structures, the causal reversible prime event structures."

A bottleneck here is that many simulation samples are required in the case of rare events, e.g. in highly reliable systems where components fail seldomly. Rare Event Simulation (RES) provides techniques to reduce the number of samples in the case of rare events. We present a RES technique based on importance splitting, to study failures in highly reliable DFTs. Whereas RES usually requires meta-information from an expert, our method is fully automatic: by cleverly exploiting the fault tree structure we extract the so-called importance function.

Due to the need of guessing for each transition whether it resets the clock, the algorithm is of exponential complexity in the size of the learned automata. Before presenting this algorithm, we propose a simpler version where the teacher is assumed to be smart in the sense of being able to provide the reset information. We show that this simpler setting yields a polynomial complexity of the learning process. Both of the algorithms are implemented and evaluated on a collection of randomly generated examples. We furthermore demonstrate the simpler algorithm on the functional specification of the TCP protocol."

Since common logics like LTL, CTL, or the modal mu-calculus cannot express hyperproperties, the hyperlogics HyperLTL and HyperCTL* were developed to cure this defect. However, these logics are not able to express arbitrary omega-regular properties. In this paper, we introduce HyperPDL-Delta, an adaptation of the Propositional Dynamic Logic of Fischer and Ladner for hyperproperties, in order to remove this limitation. Using an elegant automata-theoretic framework, we show that HyperPDL-Delta model checking is asymptotically not more expensive than HyperCTL* model checking, despite its vastly increased expressive power. We further investigate fragments of HyperPDL-Delta with regard to satisfiability checking."

Simulation is another way to carry out this kind of analysis. In this paper we review the RFT model with Repair Boxes as introduced by Daniele Codetta-Raiteri. We present compositional semantics for this model in terms of Input/Output Stochastic Automata, which allows for the modelling of events occurring according to general continuous distribution.

While MSO-RMC is in general undecidable, we recover decidability of the bounded model checking problem within this framework. For this decidability result, we introduce nondeterministic streaming $\omega$-string transducers and establish their expressive equivalence to nondeterministic MSO-definable $\omega$-string transformations. We also proof of the decidability of the regular type checking problem for nondeterministic streaming string transducers, both in the setting of finite strings and $\omega$-strings.

Concerning the fundamental analysis problem of comparing a candidate implementation against a specification, both given as TA, it has been shown that timed trace equivalence is undecidable, whereas timed bisimulation equivalence is decidable. The corresponding proof utilizes region graphs, a finite, but generally very space-consuming characterization of TA semantics. Hence, most practical TA tools utilize zone graphs instead, a symbolic and generally more efficient representation of TA semantics, to automate analysis tasks. However, zone graphs only produce sound results for analysis tasks being reducible to plain reachability problems thus being too imprecise for checking timed bisimilarity. In this paper, we propose bounded zone-history graphs, a novel characterization of TA semantics facilitating an adjustable trade-off between precision and scalability of timed-bisimilarity checking. Our tool TimBrCheck is, to the best of our knowledge, the only currently available tool for effectively checking timed bisimilarity and even supports non-deterministic TA with silent moves. We further present experimental results gained from applying our tool to a collection of community benchmarks, providing insights into trade-offs between precision and efficiency, depending on the bound value."

This paper reviews main definitions associated with F-systems and next it determines necessary conditions for a language to belong to classes generated by such systems. The conditions are stated in the form of pumping lemmas and four classes are considered, in which the core and folding procedure languages are both regular, one of them is regular and the other context-free, or both are context-free.

The name of this set comes from the fact that its characteristic sequence is given by the famous Thue-Morse word ${\tt abbabaabbaababba\cdots}$, which is the fixed point starting with ${\tt a}$ of the word morphism ${\tt a\mapsto ab,b\mapsto ba}$. The numbers in $\mathcal{T}$ are commonly called the {\em evil numbers}. We obtain an exact formula for the state complexity of the set $m\mathcal{T}+r$ (i.e.\ the number of states of its minimal automaton) with respect to any base $b$ which is a power of $2$. Our proof is constructive and we are able to explicitly provide the minimal automaton of the language of all $2^p$-expansions of the set of integers $m\mathcal{T}+r$ for any positive integers $p$ and $m$ and any remainder $r\in\{0,\ldots,m-1\}$. The proposed method is general for any $b$-recognizable set of integers. As an application, we obtain a decision procedure running in quadratic time for the problem of deciding whether a given $2^p$-recognizable set is equal to a set of the form $m\mathcal{T}+r$."
2019-10-16 19:34:55+00:00,2019-10-16 19:34:55+00:00,"Several abstract machines that operate on symbolic input alphabets have been proposed in the last decade, for example, symbolic automata or lattice automata. Applications of these types of automata include software security analysis and natural language processing. While these models provide means to describe words over infinite input alphabets, there is no considerable work on symbolic output (as present in transducers) alphabets, or even abstraction (widening) thereof. Furthermore, established approaches for transforming, for example, minimizing or reducing, finite-state machines that produce output on states or transitions are not applicable. A notion of equivalence of this type of machines is needed to make statements about whether or not transformations maintain the semantics. We present abstract transducers as a new form of finite-state transducers. Both their input alphabet and the output alphabet is composed of abstract words, where one abstract word represents a set of concrete words. The mapping between these representations is described by abstract word domains. By using words instead of single letters, abstract transducers provide the possibility of lookaheads to decide on state transitions to conduct. Since both the input symbol and the output symbol on each transition is an abstract entity, abstraction techniques can be applied naturally. We apply abstract transducers as the foundation for sharing task artifacts for reuse in context of program analysis and verification, and describe task artifacts as abstract words. A task artifact is any entity that contributes to an analysis task and its solution, for example, candidate invariants or source code to weave."

Finite LTL differs from traditional LTL in that formulas are interpreted with respect to finite, rather than infinite, sequences of states; this fact means that traditional finite-state automata, rather than {\omega}-automata such as those developed by B\""uchi and others, suffice for recognizing models of such formulas. The approach considered is based on well-known tableau-construction techniques developed for LTL, which we adapt here for the setting of Finite LTL. The resulting automata may be used as a basis for model checking, satisfiability testing, and model synthesis."

For example, the performance of a web server may be monitored based on the ratio of the total count of requests from the least and most active clients. Exact frequency monitoring, however, can be prohibitively expensive; in the above example it would require as many counters as there are clients. In this paper, we propose the efficient probabilistic monitoring of common frequency properties, including the mode (i.e., the most common event) and the median of an event sequence. We define a logic to express composite frequency properties as a combination of atomic frequency properties. Our main contribution is an algorithm that, under suitable probabilistic assumptions, can be used to monitor these important frequency properties with four counters, independent of the number of different events. Our algorithm samples longer and longer subwords of an infinite event sequence. We prove the almost-sure convergence of our algorithm by generalizing ergodic theory from increasing-length prefixes to increasing-length subwords of an infinite sequence. A similar algorithm could be used to learn a connected Markov chain of a given structure from observing its outputs, to arbitrary precision, for a given confidence."

The specifications describe assumptions about an environment and guarantees to be achieved by the controller operating in that environment. If a controller exists, given the assumptions, the specification is said to be realizable. This paper focuses on finding a minimal set of assumptions that guarantee realizability in the context of counterstrategy-guided assumption refinement procedures. Specifically, we introduce the notion of minimal assumptions refinements and provide an algorithm that provably computes these with little time overhead. We show experimentally, using common benchmarks, that embedding our algorithm in state-of-the-art approaches for assumption refinement results in consistently shorter solutions than without such embedding, and allows to explore a higher number of candidate solutions. We also propose a hybrid variant for dealing with the higher sparsity of solutions in the space of minimal refinements and show that its application speeds up the identification of a solution."

Several techniques have been successfully developed to verify robustness, and are now able to evaluate neural networks with thousands of nodes. The main weakness of this approach is in the specification: robustness is asserted on a validation set consisting of a finite set of examples, i.e. locally.   We propose a notion of global robustness based on generative models, which asserts the robustness on a very large and representative set of examples. We show how this can be used for verifying neural networks. In this paper we experimentally explore the merits of this approach, and show how it can be used to construct realistic adversarial examples."

Despite their simplicity, they still lack a satisfactory causally reversible semantics. We develop such semantics for Place/Transitions Petri nets (P/T nets) based on two observations. Firstly, a net that explicitly expresses causality and conflict among events, for example an occurrence net, can be straightforwardly reversed by adding a reverse transition for each of its forward transitions. Secondly, given a P/T net the standard unfolding construction associates with it an occurrence net that preserves all of its computation. Consequently, the reversible semantics of a P/T net can be obtained as the reversible semantics of its unfolding. We show that such reversible behaviour can be expressed as a finite net whose tokens are coloured by causal histories. Colours in our encoding resemble the causal memories that are typical in reversible process calculi."

Czerwi\'nski et al. (2019) observe that four of the algorithms can be expressed as constructions of separating automata (of quasi-polynomial size), that is, automata that accept all plays decisively won by one of the players, and rejecting all plays decisively won by the other player. The separating automata corresponding to three of the algorithms are deterministic, and it is clear that deterministic separating automata can be used to solve parity games. The separating automaton corresponding to the algorithm of Lehtinen is nondeterministic, though. While this particular automaton can be used to solve parity games, this is not true for every nondeterministic separating automaton. As a first (more conceptual) contribution, we specify when a nondeterministic separating automaton can be used to solve parity games.   We also repeat the correctness proof of the Lehtinen's algorithm, using separating automata. In this part, we prove that her construction actually leads to a faster algorithm than originally claimed in her paper: its complexity is $n^{O(\log n)}$ rather than $n^{O(\log d \cdot \log n)}$ (where $n$ is the number of nodes, and $d$ the number of priorities of a considered parity game), which is similar to complexities of the other quasi-polynomial-time algorithms."

However, the strong well structured problem is decidable for all Presburger counter machines. While Affine VASS of dimension one are not, in general, well structured, we give an algorithm that computes the set of predecessors of a configuration; as a consequence this allows to decide the well structured problem for 1-Affine VASS."

Namely, we introduce a notion of flat rational sets: if $M$ is a monoid and $N\leq M$ is its submonoid, then flat rational sets of $M$ relative to $N$ are finite unions of the form $L_0g_1L_1 \cdots g_t L_t$ where all $L_i$s are rational subsets of $N$ and $g_i\in M$. We give quite general sufficient conditions under which flat rational sets form an effective relative Boolean algebra. As a corollary, we obtain that the emptiness problem for Boolean combinations of flat rational subsets of $\mathrm{GL}(2,\mathbb{Q})$ over $\mathrm{GL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ is decidable.   We also show a dichotomy for nontrivial group extension of $\mathrm{GL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ in $\mathrm{GL}(2,\mathbb{Q})$: if $G$ is a f.g. group such that $\mathrm{GL}(2,\mathbb{Z}) < G \leq \mathrm{GL}(2,\mathbb{Q})$, then either $G\cong \mathrm{GL}(2,\mathbb{Z})\times \mathbb{Z}^k$, for some $k\geq 1$, or $G$ contains an extension of the Baumslag-Solitar group $\mathrm{BS}(1,q)$, with $q\geq2$, of infinite index. It turns out that in the first case the membership problem for $G$ is decidable but the equality problem for rational subsets of $G$ is undecidable. In the second case, the membership problem for $G$ is an open problem as it is open for $\mathrm{BS}(1,q)$.   In the last section we prove new decidability results for flat rational sets that contain singular matrices. In particular, we show that the membership problem is decidable for flat rational subsets of $M(2,\mathbb{Q})$ relative to the submonoid that is generated by the matrices from $M(2,\mathbb{Z})$ with determinants $0,\pm1$ and the central rational matrices."

This generalizes a result of Lombardy and Mairesse of 2006 stating that series which are both max-plus and min-plus rational are unambiguous. This generalization goes in two directions: trees are considered instead of words, and separation is established instead of characterization (separation implies characterization). The techniques in the two proofs are very different."

Linear temporal logic (LTL) provides a formal language to specify the desired behavioral properties of systems. In applications in which the specifications originate from various aspects of the system design, or consist of a large set of formulas, the overall system specification may be unrealizable. Driven by this fact, we develop an optimization variant of synthesis from LTL formulas, where the goal is to design a controller that satisfies a set of hard specifications and minimally violates a set of soft specifications. To that end, we introduce a value function that, by exploiting the LTL semantics, quantifies the level of violation of properties. Inspired by the idea of bounded synthesis, we fix a bound on the implementation size and search for an implementation that is optimal with respect to the said value function. We propose a novel maximum satisfiability encoding of the search for an optimal implementation (within the given bound on the implementation size). We iteratively increase the bound on the implementation size until a termination criterion, such as a threshold over the value function, is met."

We also develop a simplified and faster version of the general algorithm for the sub-class of so-called monadic CAs (MCAs), i.e., CAs with counting loops on character classes, which are common in practice. Our main motivation is (besides applications in verification and decision procedures of logics) the application of deterministic (M)CAs in pattern matching regular expressions with counting, which are very common in e.g. network traffic processing and log analysis. We have evaluated our algorithm against practical benchmarks from these application domains and concluded that compared to the na\""ive approach, our algorithm is much less prone to explode, produces automata that can be several orders of magnitude smaller, and is overall faster."

The box should leave the line with the open lid facing upwards with the liquid still in it. To save costs there are no complex sensors or image recognition software available on the assembly line, so a reset sequence needs to be computed. But how can the dependencies of the deforming impact of a transformation of the box, such as 'do not tilt the box over when the lid is open' or 'open the lid again each time it gets closed' be modeled? We present three attempts to model constraints of these kinds on the order in which the states of an automaton are transitioned by a synchronizing word. The first two concepts relate the last visits of states and form constraints on which states still need to be reached, whereas the third concept concerns the first visits of states and forms constraints on which states might still be reached. We examine the computational complexity of different variants of the problem, whether an automaton can be synchronized with a word that respects the constraints defined in the respective concept, and obtain nearly a full classification. While most of the problems are PSPACE-complete we also observe NP-complete variants and variants solvable in polynomial time. We will also observe a drop of the complexity if we track the orders of states on several paths simultaneously instead of tracking the set of active states. Further, we give upper bounds on the length of a synchronizing word depending on the size of the input relation and show that the Cerny conjecture holds for partial weakly acyclic automata."

In this paper, we present optimistic value iteration, a new sound approach that leverages value iteration's ability to usually deliver tight lower bounds: we obtain a lower bound via standard value iteration, use the result to ""guess"" an upper bound, and prove the latter's correctness. Optimistic value iteration is easy to implement, does not require extra precomputations or a priori state space transformations, and works for computing reachability probabilities as well as expected rewards. It is also fast, as we show via an extensive experimental evaluation using our publicly available implementation within the Modest Toolset."

The key ingredient to make this possible is a novel notion of controllability.

We synthesize edit functions to solve the opacity enforcement problem in a modular setting, which significantly reduces the computational complexity compared with the monolithic approach. Two abstraction methods called opaque observation equivalence and opaque bisimulation are first employed to abstract the individual components of the modular system and their observers. Subsequently, we propose a method to transform the synthesis of edit functions to the calculation of modular supremal nonblocking supervisors. We show that the edit functions synthesized in this manner correctly solve the opacity enforcement problem."

Several papers have compared these independently developed relations, but these comparisons make assumptions (e.g., input-enabledness), pose restrictions (e.g., determinism - then they all coincide), use different models (e.g., interface automata and Kripke structures), or do not deal with the concept of quiescence. In this paper, we present the integration of the ioco/uioco theory of model-based testing and the theory of alternating refinements, within the domain of non-deterministic, non-input-enabled interface automata. A standing conjecture is that ioco and alternating-trace containment coincide. Our main result is that this conjecture does not hold, but that uioco coincides with a variant of alternating-trace containment, for image finite interface automata and with explicit treatment of quiescence. From the comparison between ioco theory and alternating refinements, we conclude that ioco and the original relation of alternating-trace containment are too strong for realistic black-box scenarios. We present a refinement relation which can express both uioco and refinement in game theory, while being simpler and having a clearer observational interpretation."

Here, we present a new sound and automated approach to obtain optimal sizing using an unprecedented program synthesis. Our variant of counterexample guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS) approach has two phases linking the technical and cost analysis: first we synthesize a feasible candidate based on power reliability, but that may not achieve the lowest cost; second, the candidate is then verified iteratively with a lower bound cost via symbolic model checking. If the verification step does not fail, the lower bound is adjusted; and if it fails, a counterexample provides the optimal solution. Experimental results using seven case studies and commercial equipment data show that our synthesis method can produce within an acceptable run-time the optimal system sizing. We also present a comparative with a specialized simulation tool over real photovoltaic systems to show the effectiveness of our approach, which can provide a more detailed and accurate solution than that simulation tool."

The liveness verification problem asks whether there is an infinite computation of the system in which the leader reaches a final state infinitely often. Like its reachability counterpart, the problem is known to be NP-complete. Our results show that, even from a fine-grained point of view, the complexities differ only by a polynomial factor.   Liveness verification decomposes into reachability and cycle detection. We present a fixed point iteration solving the latter in polynomial time. For reachability, we reconsider the two standard parameterizations. When parameterized by the number of states of the leader L and the size of the data domain D, we show an (L + D)^O(L + D)-time algorithm. It improves on a previous algorithm, thereby settling an open problem. When parameterized by the number of states of the contributor C, we reuse an O*(2^C)-time algorithm. We show how to connect both algorithms with the cycle detection to obtain algorithms for liveness verification. The running times of the composed algorithms match those of reachability, proving that the fine-grained lower bounds for liveness verification are met."

Synthesizing correct-by-design control laws is a challenging task resulting in computationally demanding methods. We consider efficient automata-based planning for continuous-time systems under signal interval temporal logic specifications, an expressive fragment of signal temporal logic. The planning is based on recent results for automata-based verification of metric interval temporal logic. A timed signal transducer is obtained accepting all Boolean signals that satisfy a metric interval temporal logic specification, which is abstracted from the signal interval temporal logic specification at hand. This transducer is modified to account for the spatial properties of the signal interval temporal logic specification, characterizing all real-valued signals that satisfy this specification. Using logic-based feedback control laws, such as the ones we have presented in earlier works, we then provide an abstraction of the system that, in a suitable way, aligns with the modified timed signal transducer. This allows to avoid the state space explosion that is typically induced by forming a product automaton between an abstraction of the system and the specification."

Many medical best practice guidelines exist, but most of the existing guidelines in handbooks are difficult for medical staff to remember and apply clinically. Furthermore, although the guidelines have gone through clinical validations, validations by medical professionals alone do not provide guarantees for the safety of medical cyber-physical systems. Hence, formal verification is also needed. The paper presents the formal semantics for a framework that we developed to support the development of verifiably safe medical guidelines.   The framework allows computer scientists to work together with medical professionals to transform medical best practice guidelines into executable statechart models, Yakindu in particular, so that medical functionalities and properties can be quickly prototyped and validated. Existing formal verification technologies, UPPAAL timed automata in particular, is integrated into the framework to provide formal verification capabilities to verify safety properties. However, some components used/built into the framework, such as the open-source Yakindu statecharts as well as the transformation rules from statecharts to timed automata, do not have built-in semantics.

In order to tackle this disturbing problem we show how to effectively construct deterministic timed automata $A_d$ and $B_d$ that are discretizations (digitizations) of the non-deterministic timed automata $A$ and $B$ and differ from the original automata by at most $\frac{1}{6}$ time units on each occurrence of an event. Language inclusion in the discretized timed automata is decidable and it is also decidable when instead of $\mathfrak{L}(B)$ we consider $\overline{\mathfrak{L}(B)}$, the closure of ${\mathfrak{L}(B)}$ in the Euclidean topology: if $\mathfrak{L}(A_d) \nsubseteq \mathfrak{L}(B_d)$ then $\mathfrak{L}(A) \nsubseteq \mathfrak{L}(B)$ and if $\mathfrak{L}(A_d) \subseteq \mathfrak{L}(B_d)$ then $\mathfrak{L}(A) \subseteq \overline{\mathfrak{L}(B)}$.   Moreover, if $\mathfrak{L}(A_d) \nsubseteq \mathfrak{L}(B_d)$ we would like to know how far away is $\mathfrak{L}(A_d)$ from being included in $\mathfrak{L}(B_d)$. For that matter we define the distance between the languages of timed automata as the limit on how far away a timed trace of one timed automaton can be from the closest timed trace of the other timed automaton. We then show how one can decide under some restriction whether the distance between two timed automata is finite or infinite."
2019-09-23 10:12:13+00:00,2019-09-23 10:12:13+00:00,"We study the problem of recognizing regular languages in a variant of the streaming model of computation, called the sliding window model. In this model, we are given a size of the sliding window $n$ and a stream of symbols. At each time instant, we must decide whether the suffix of length $n$ of the current stream (""the active window"") belongs to a given regular language.   Recent works showed that the space complexity of an optimal deterministic sliding window algorithm for this problem is either constant, logarithmic or linear in the window size $n$ and provided natural language theoretic characterizations of the space complexity classes. Subsequently, those results were extended to randomized algorithms to show that any such algorithm admits either constant, double logarithmic, logarithmic or linear space complexity.   In this work, we make an important step forward and combine the sliding window model with the property testing setting, which results in ultra-efficient algorithms for all regular languages. Informally, a sliding window property tester must accept the active window if it belongs to the language and reject it if it is far from the language. We consider deterministic and randomized sliding window property testers with one-sided and two-sided errors. In particular, we show that for any regular language, there is a deterministic sliding window property tester that uses logarithmic space and a randomized sliding window property tester with two-sided error that uses constant space."

In the second and the third variations a configuration is a rectangular wall such that the ratio of the length of the two horizontal walls to that of the two vertical walls is fixed.

These games can be solved by value iteration as well as strategy iteration, each of them yielding a sequence of under-approximations of the reachability value and a sequence of over-approximation of the safety value, converging to it in the limit. For both approaches, we provide the first (anytime) algorithms with stopping criteria. The stopping criterion for value iteration is based on providing a convergent sequence of over-approximations, which then allows to estimate the distance to the true value. For strategy iteration, we bound the error by complementing the strategy iteration algorithm for reachability by a new strategy iteration algorithm under-approximating the safety-value."

The numbers in T are sometimes called the evil numbers. We obtain an exact formula for the state complexity (i.e. the number of states of its minimal automaton) of the multiplication by a constant of the Thue-Morse set with respect to any integer base b which is a power of 2. Our proof is constructive and we are able to explicitly provide the minimal automaton of the language of all 2^p-expansions of the set mT for any positive integers m and p. The used method is general for any b-recognizable set of integers.

A run-time enforcement shield is a controller which takes (I,O) (coming from SSE) as its input, and it produces a corrected output O' which guarantees the invariance of requirement REQ(I,O'). Moreover, the output sequence O' must deviate from O ""as little as possible"" to maintain the quality. In this paper, we give a method for logical specification of shields using formulas of logic Quantified Discrete Duration Calculus (QDDC). The specification consists of a correctness requirement REQ as well as a hard deviation constraint HDC which must both be mandatorily and invariantly satisfied by the shield. Moreover, we also use quantitative optimization to give a shield which minimizes the expected value of cumulative deviation in an H-optimal fashion. We show how tool DCSynth implementing soft requirement guided synthesis can be used for automatic synthesis of shields from a given specification. Next, we give logical formulas specifying several notions of shields including the k-Stabilizing shield of Bloem ""et al."" as well as the Burst-error shield of Wu ""et al."", and a new e,d-shield. Shields can be automatically synthesized for all these specifications using the tool DCSynth.

However, many shortcomings of LTL have been identified in the literature, among them the limited expressiveness, the lack of quantitative features, and the inability to express robustness. There is work on overcoming these shortcomings, but each of these is typically addressed in isolation. This is insufficient for applications where all shortcomings manifest themselves simultaneously. Here, we tackle this issue by introducing logics that address more than one shortcoming. To this end, we combine the logics Linear Dynamic Logic, Prompt-LTL, and robust LTL, each addressing one aspect, to new logics. For all combinations of two aspects, the resulting logic has the same desirable algorithmic properties as plain LTL. In particular, the highly efficient algorithmic backends that have been developed for LTL are also applicable to these new logics. Finally, we discuss how to address all three aspects simultaneously."

At the same time, with the emergence of the (industrial) Internet-of-Things, systems are more and more often being monitored via advanced sensor systems. These sensors produce large amounts of data about the components' failure behaviour, and can, therefore, be fruitfully exploited to learn reliability models automatically. This paper presents an effective algorithm for learning a prominent class of reliability models, namely fault trees, from observational data. Our algorithm is evolutionary in nature; i.e., is an iterative, population-based, randomized search method among fault-tree structures that are increasingly more consistent with the observational data. We have evaluated our method on a large number of case studies, both on synthetic data, and industrial data. Our experiments show that our algorithm outperforms other methods and provides near-optimal results."

Choreographies specify interactions among distributed participants coordinating among themselves with message-passing at two levels of abstractions. A global view of the application is specified with a model that abstracts away from asynchrony while a local view of the application specifies the communication pattern of each participant. Noteworthy, the latter view can typically be algorithmically obtained by projection of the global view. A crucial element of this approach is to verify the so-called well-formed conditions on global views so that its projections realise a sound communication protocol. We introduce a novel local model, group interface automata, to represent the local view of choreographies and propose a new method to verify the well-formedness of global choreographies. We rely on a recently proposed semantics of global views formalised in terms of pomsets."

The model considered is that of ACAs, which are language acceptors whose acceptance condition depends on the states of all cells in the automaton. We prove a time hierarchy theorem for sublinear-time ACA classes, analyze their intersection with the regular languages, and, finally, establish strict inclusions in the parallel computation classes $\mathsf{SC}$ and (uniform) $\mathsf{AC}$. As an addendum, we introduce and investigate the concept of a decider ACA (DACA) as a candidate for a decider counterpart to (acceptor) ACAs. We show the class of languages decidable in constant time by DACAs equals the locally testable languages, and we also determine $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ as the (tight) time complexity threshold for DACAs up to which no advantage compared to constant time is possible."

This closure enables us to exploit state-space reduction techniques, such as those based on direct and delayed simulation, that guarantee simulation equivalence.

More specifically, we carry out a generic calculation of the product (and therefore the commutator) of time-evolution operators for any two labelled-graph grammar rewrite rules, where the operator corresponding to each rule is defined in terms of elementary two-state creation/annihilation operators. The resulting graph grammar algebra has the following properties: (1) The product and commutator of two such operators is a sum of such operators with integer coefficients. Thus, the algebra and the Lie algebra occurs entirely at the structural (or graph-combinatorial) level of graph grammar rules, lifted from the level of elementary creation/annihilation operators (an improvement over [1], Propositions 1 and 2). (2) The product of the off-diagonal (state-changing) parts of two such graph rule operators is a sum of off-diagonal graph rule operators with non-negative integer coefficients. (3) These results apply whether the semantics of a graph grammar rule leaves behind hanging edges (Theorem 1), or removes hanging edges (Theorem 2). (4) The algebra is constructive in terms of elementary two-state creation/annihilation operators (Corollaries 3 and 8). These results are useful because dynamical transformations of labelled graphs comprise a general modeling framework, and algebraic commutators of time-evolution operators have many analytic uses including designing simulation algorithms and estimating their errors."

Thereupon, several real-time extensions of ioco, usually called tioco, have been proposed, further taking into account permitted delays between actions. In this paper, we propose an improved version of tioco, called live timed ioco (ltioco), tackling various weaknesses of existing definitions. Here, a reasonable adaptation of quiescence (i.e., observable absence of any outputs) to real-time behaviors has to be done with care: ltioco therefore distinguishes safe outputs being allowed to happen, from live outputs being enforced to happen within a certain time period thus inducing two different facets of quiescence. Furthermore, tioco is frequently defined on Timed I/O Labeled Transition Systems (TIOLTS), a semantic model of Timed I/O Automata (TIOA) which is infinitely branching and thus infeasible for practical testing tools. Instead, we extend the theory of zone graphs to enable ltioco testing on a finite semantic model of TIOA. Finally, we investigate compositionality of ltioco with respect to parallel composition including a proper treatment of silent transitions."

We give a polynomial-time algorithm for verification, and show GI and NP-hardness for deciding conjugacy and reducing representation size, respectively.

Given their tremendous computational complexity, practical approaches have relied on techniques such as reachability relaxations, e.g., allowing for negative intermediate counter values. It is natural to question their feasibility for VASS enriched with primitives that typically translate into undecidability. Spurred by this concern, we pinpoint the complexity of integer relaxations with respect to arbitrary classes of affine operations.   More specifically, we provide a trichotomy on the complexity of integer reachability in VASS extended with affine operations (affine VASS). Namely, we show that it is NP-complete for VASS with resets, PSPACE-complete for VASS with (pseudo-)transfers and VASS with (pseudo-)copies, and undecidable for any other class. We further present a dichotomy for standard reachability in affine VASS: it is decidable for VASS with permutations, and undecidable for any other class. This yields a complete and unified complexity landscape of reachability in affine VASS. We also consider the reachability problem parameterized by a fixed affine VASS, rather than a class, and we show that the complexity landscape is arbitrary in this setting."

The computational engine of a splicing system is the ""splicing operation"", a cut-and-paste binary string operation defined by a set of ""splicing rules"" $r = (\alpha_1, \alpha_2 ; \alpha_3, \alpha_4)$ where $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4$ are words over an alphabet $\Sigma$. For two strings $x = x_1 \alpha_1 \alpha_2 x_2$ and $y = y_1 \alpha_3 \alpha_4 y_2$, applying the splicing rule $r$ produces the string $z = x_1 \alpha_1 \alpha_4 y_2$.   In this paper we focus on a particular type of splicing systems, called $(i, j)$ semi-simple splicing systems, $i = 1,2$ and $j = 3, 4$, wherein all splicing rules have the property that the two strings in positions $i$ and $j$ are singleton letters, while the other two strings are empty. The language generated by such a system consists of the set of words that are obtained starting from an initial set called ""axiom set"", by iteratively applying the splicing rules to strings in the axiom set as well as to intermediately produced strings. We consider semi-simple splicing systems where the axiom set is a regular language, and investigate the descriptional complexity of such systems in terms of the size of the minimal deterministic finite automata that recognize the languages they generate."

FSSP has many variations and for many of them we know minimal-time solutions (solutions having shortest firing time). One of such variations is the FSSP for squares (denoted by SQ) in which copies are placed in a square. In this paper we introduce a variation which we call the FSSP for squares with k holes and denote by SH[k] by slightly modifying SQ (k >= 1). In the variation, copies of a finite automaton are placed in a square but there are k positions (""holes"") in the square where no copies are placed. We show that SH[1] has a minimal-time solution. Moreover, for each problem instance (a placement of copies in a square) C of SH[2], we determine the minimum firing time of C (the minimum value of firing times of C by A where A ranges over all solutions of SH[2]). The variation SQ was introduced and its minimal-time solutions were found in 1970's. However, to find minimal-time solutions of SH[k], a very simple modification of SQ, seems to be a very difficult and challenging problem for k >= 2."

For instance, the regular spanners are the closure under the Relational Algebra (RA) of the regular expressions with capture variables, and the expressive power of the regular spanners is precisely captured by the class of VSet-automata - a restricted class of transducers that mark the endpoints of selected spans.   In this work, we embark on the investigation of document spanners that can annotate extractions with auxiliary information such as confidence, support, and confidentiality measures. To this end, we adopt the abstraction of provenance semirings by Green et al., where tuples of a relation are annotated with the elements of a commutative semiring, and where the annotation propagates through the (positive) RA operators via the semiring operators. Hence, the proposed spanner extension, referred to as an annotator, maps every string into an annotated relation over the spans. As a specific instantiation, we explore weighted VSet-automata that, similarly to weighted automata and transducers, attach semiring elements to transitions. We investigate key aspects of expressiveness, such as the closure under the positive RA, and key aspects of computational complexity, such as the enumeration of annotated answers and their ranked enumeration in the case of numeric semirings. For a number of these problems, fundamental properties of the underlying semiring, such as positivity, are crucial for establishing tractability."

When $A$ is entropic (i.e. all finitary operations are homomorphisms), we establish that the set $\text{EndCA}(G;A)$, consisting of all such cellular automata, is isomorphic to the direct limit of $\text{Hom}(A^S, A)$, where $S$ runs among all finite subsets of $G$. In particular, when $A$ is an $R$-module, we show that $\text{EndCA}(G;A)$ is isomorphic to the group algebra $\text{End}(A)[G]$. Moreover, when $A$ is a finite Boolean algebra, we establish that the number of endomorphic cellular automata over $A^G$ admitting a memory set $S$ is precisely $(k \vert S \vert)^k$, where $k$ is the number of atoms of $A$."

This challenge becomes even harder when some timing constants are missing or unknown. Parametric timed formalisms, such as parametric timed automata (PTAs), tackle the synthesis of such timing constants (seen as parameters) for which a property holds. Such formalisms are highly expressive, but also undecidable, and few decidable subclasses were proposed. We propose here a syntactic restriction on PTAs consisting in removing guards (constraints on transitions) to keep only invariants (constraints on locations). While this restriction preserves the expressiveness of PTAs (and therefore their undecidability), an additional restriction on the type of constraints allows to not only prove decidability, but also to perform the exact synthesis of parameter valuations satisfying reachability. This formalism, that seems trivial at first sight as it benefits from the decidability of the reachability problem with a better complexity than Timed Automata (TAs), suffers from the undecidability of the whole TCTL logic that TAs, on the contrary enjoy. We believe our formalism allows for an interesting trade-off between decidability and practical expressiveness and is therefore promising. We show its applicability in a small case study."

While we can formally apply the $\rightarrow$ operator to define a live process's behavior, the STOP process, which usually resulted from deadlock, starving or livelock, is lack of formal description, defined by most literatures as ""doing nothing but halt"". In this paper, we argue that the STOP process should not be considered as a black box, it should follow the prefix $\rightarrow$ schema and the same inference rules so that a unified and consistent process algebra model can be established. In order to achieve this goal, we introduce a special event called ""nil"" that any process can take. This nil event will do nothing meaningful and leave nothing on a process's observable record. With the nil event and its well-defined rules, we can successfully use the $\rightarrow$ operator to formally describe a process's complete behavior in its whole life circle. More interestingly, we can use prefix $\rightarrow$ and nil event to fully describe the STOP process's internal behavior and conclude that the STOP's formal equation can be given as simple as STOP$_{\alpha X} = \mu$ X. nil $\rightarrow$ X."

The exact answers to the probabilistic questions for non-deterministic automata can be irrational and are uncomputable in general. To overcome this limitation, we propose approximation algorithms for the probabilistic questions, which work in exponential time in the size of the automaton and polynomial time in the size of the Markov chain and the given precision. We apply this result to show that non-deterministic automata can be effectively determinised with respect to the standard deviation metric."

This raises the question whether under mild assumptions, regular separability can be reduced to intersection emptiness and vice-versa.   We present counterexamples showing that none of the two problems can be reduced to the other.

Recent work at the intersection of formal language theory and graph theory has explored the use of graph grammars for graph modeling. However, existing graph grammar formalisms, like Hyperedge Replacement Grammars, can only operate on small tree-like graphs. The present work relaxes this restriction by revising a different graph grammar formalism called Vertex Replacement Grammars (VRGs). We show that a variant of the VRG called Clustering-based Node Replacement Grammar (CNRG) can be efficiently extracted from many hierarchical clusterings of a graph. We show that CNRGs encode a succinct model of the graph, yet faithfully preserves the structure of the original graph. In experiments on large real-world datasets, we show that graphs generated from the CNRG model exhibit a diverse range of properties that are similar to those found in the original networks."

We aim to shed light on our understanding of global patterns that occur on infinite strings. We utilise methods of geometric group theory. Our emphasis is on large scale geometries. Two infinite strings have the same large scale geometry if there are colour preserving bi-Lipschitz maps with distortions between the strings. Call these maps quasi-isometries. Introduction of large scale geometries poses several questions. The first question asks to study the partial order induced by quasi-isometries. This partial order compares large scale geometries; as such it presents an algebraic tool for classification of global patterns. We prove there is a greatest large scale geometry and infinitely many minimal large scale geometries. The second question is related to understanding the quasi-isometric maps on various classes of strings. The third question investigates the sets of large scale geometries of strings accepted by computational models, e.g. B\""uchi automata. We provide an algorithm that describes large scale geometries of strings accepted by B\""uchi automata. This links large scale geometries with automata theory. The fourth question studies the complexity of the quasi-isometry problem. We show the problem is $\Sigma_3^0$-complete thus providing a bridge with computability theory. Finally, the fifth question asks to build algebraic structures that are invariants of large scale geometries. We invoke asymptotic cones, a key concept in geometric group theory, defined via model-theoretic notion of ultra-product. Partly, we study asymptotic cones of algorithmically random strings thus connecting the topic with algorithmic randomness."

Thus, we can identify some conditions on the shape of regular equations under which resulting solutions are unambiguous.   We apply our result to convert a DFA to an unambiguous regular expression.

But trace closures of regular languages are in general not regular, hence these automata cannot generally be finite. Still, as we show, for star-connected expressions, the Antimirov and Brzozowski automata, suitably quotiented, are finite. We also define a refined version of the Antimirov reordering derivative operation where parts-of-derivatives (states of the automaton) are nonempty lists of regular expressions rather than single regular expressions. We define the uniform scattering rank of a language and show that, for a regexp whose language has finite uniform scattering rank, the truncation of the (generally infinite) refined Antimirov automaton, obtained by removing long states, is finite without any quotienting, but still accepts the trace closure. We also show that star-connected languages have finite uniform scattering rank."

The monitor controls the evolution of the whole system but it is mined from the data produced by its single interacting components. Relevant behavioural changes happening at the component level and that are responsible for global system evolution are captured by the monitor. Topological Data Analysis is used for shaping and analysing the data for mining an automaton mimicking the global system dynamics, the so-called Persistent Entropy Automaton (PEA). A slight augmented PEA, the monitor, can be used to run current or past executions of the system to mine temporal invariants, for instance through statistical reasoning. Such invariants can be formulated as properties of a temporal logic, e.g. bounded LTL, that can be run-time model-checked. We have performed a feasibility assessment of the PEA and the associated monitoring system by analysing a simulated biological complex system, namely the human immune system. The application of the monitor to simulated traces reveals temporal properties that should be satisfied in order to reach immunization memory."

This lack of homogeneity makes the integration and security management of IoT infrastructures a daunting task for users and administrators. In this paper, we introduce VISCR, a Vendor-Independent policy Specification and Conflict Resolution engine that enables conflict-free policy specification and enforcement in IoT environments. VISCR converts the topology of the IoT infrastructure into a tree-based abstraction and translates existing policies from heterogeneous vendor-specific programming languages such as Groovy-based SmartThings, OpenHAB, IFTTT-based templates, and MUD-based profiles into a vendor-independent graph-based specification. Using the two, VISCR can automatically detect rouge policies, conflicts, and bugs for coherent automation. Upon detection, VISCR infers new policies and proposes them to users as alternatives to existing policies for fine-tuning and conflict-free enforcement. We evaluated VISCR using a dataset of 907 IoT apps, programmed using heterogeneous automation specifications in a simulated smart-building IoT infrastructure. In our experiments, among 907 IoT apps, VISCR exposed 342 of IoT apps as exhibiting one or more violations. VISCR detected 100% of violations reported by existing state-of-the-art tool, while detecting new types of violations in an additional 266 apps. In terms of performance, VISCR can generate 400 abstraction trees (used in specifying policies) with 100K leaf nodes in <1.2sec. In our experiments, VISCR took 80.7 seconds to analyze our infrastructure of 907 apps; a 14.2X reduction compared to the state-of-the-art. After the initial analysis, VISCR is capable of adopting new policies in sub-second latency to handle changes."

I emphasize that automata are elementary playgrounds where we can explore the issues of deterministic and nondeterministic computation.

The expressive power of partially ordered automata is closely related to the expressivity of fragments of first-order logic on finite words or, equivalently, to the language classes of the levels of the Straubing-Th\'erien hierarchy. Several fragments (levels) have been intensively investigated under various names. For instance, the fragment of first-order formulae with a single existential block of quantifiers in prenex normal form is known as piecewise testable languages or $J$-trivial languages. These languages are characterized by confluent partially ordered DFAs or by complete, confluent, and self-loop-deterministic partially ordered NFAs (ptNFAs for short). In this paper, we study the complexity of basic questions for several types of partially ordered automata on finite words; namely, the questions of inclusion, equivalence, and ($k$-)piecewise testability. The lower-bound complexity boils down to the complexity of universality. The universality problem asks whether a system recognizes all words over its alphabet. For ptNFAs, the complexity of universality decreases if the alphabet is fixed, but it is open if the alphabet may grow with the number of states. We show that deciding universality for general ptNFAs is as hard as for general NFAs. Our proof is a novel and nontrivial extension of our recent construction for self-loop-deterministic partially ordered NFAs, a model strictly more expressive than ptNFAs. We provide a comprehensive picture of the complexities of the problems of inclusion, equivalence, and ($k$-)piecewise testability for the considered types of automata."

However, for sufficiently complex systems model checking becomes computationally infeasible.

Searching for synergies between these two approaches, this paper proposes a framework to ensure reliability of industrial automation systems by means of hybrid use of model checking and testing. This framework represents a way to achieve a trade-off between verification reliability and computational complexity which has not yet been explored in other approaches. Instead of undergoing usual model checking, system requirements are checked only on particular system behaviors which represent a test suite achieving coverage for both the system and the requirements. Then, all stages of the framework support the case of a closed-loop model, where not only the controller, but also the plant is modeled."

Although this theory is widely used, e.g., to check conformance of protocol implementations, its applicability is limited by restrictions of the FSM framework: the fact that inputs and outputs alternate in an FSM, and outputs are fully determined by the previous input and state. Labeled Transition Systems with inputs and outputs (LTSs), as studied in ioco testing theory, provide a richer framework for testing component oriented systems, but lack the algorithms for test generation from FSM theory.   In this article, we propose an algorithm for the fundamental problem of state identification during testing of LTSs. Our algorithm is a direct generalization of the well-known algorithm for computing adaptive distinguishing sequences for FSMs proposed by Lee & Yannakakis. Our algorithm has to deal with so-called compatible states, states that cannot be distinguished in case of an adversarial system-under-test. Analogous to the result of Lee & Yannakakis, we prove that if an (adaptive) test exists that distinguishes all pairs of incompatible states of an LTS, our algorithm will find one. In practice, such adaptive tests typically do not exist. However, in experiments with an implementation of our algorithm on an industrial benchmark, we find that tests produced by our algorithm still distinguish more than 99% of the incompatible state pairs."

In this paper, we develop techniques for checking fast termination of pVASS with nondeterminism.   That is, for every initial configuration of size n, we consider the worst expected number of transitions needed to reach a configuration with some counter negative (the expected termination time). We show that the problem whether the asymptotic expected termination time is linear is decidable in polynomial time for a certain natural class of pVASS with nondeterminism. Furthermore, we show the following dichotomy: if the asymptotic expected termination time is not linear, then it is at least quadratic, i.e., in $\Omega(n^2)$."

In this article, we study these models through the lens of succinct data structures where our ultimate goal is to encode these mathematical objects using information-theoretically optimal number of bits along with supporting queries on them efficiently. Towards this goal, we first design a succinct data structure for representing any deterministic finite automaton $\mathcal{D}$ having $n$ states over a $\sigma$-letter alphabet $\Sigma$ using $(\sigma-1) n\log n + O(n \log \sigma)$ bits of space, which can determine, given an input string $x$ over $\Sigma$, whether $\mathcal{D}$ accepts $x$ in $O(|x| \log \sigma)$ time, using constant words of working space. When the input deterministic finite automaton is acyclic, not only we can improve the above space-bound significantly to $(\sigma -1) (n-1)\log n+ 3n + O(\log^2 \sigma) + o(n)$ bits, we also obtain optimal query time for string acceptance checking. More specifically, using our succinct representation, we can check if a given input string $x$ can be accepted by the acyclic deterministic finite automaton using time proportional to the length of $x$, hence, the optimal query time. We also exhibit a succinct data structure for representing a non-deterministic finite automaton $\mathcal{N}$ having $n$ states over a $\sigma$-letter alphabet $\Sigma$ using $\sigma n^2+n$ bits of space, such that given an input string $x$, we can decide whether $\mathcal{N}$ accepts $x$ efficiently in $O(n^2|x|)$ time.

In chapter 3 we introduce regular expressions and regular expression matching. Chapter 4 connects the theory of regular languages and derivatives with that of finite automata. Chapter 5 looks at the concept of anchors, and how this can be incorporated into a matcher based on derivatives. Chapter 6 discusses submatching using derivatives with an approach inspired by Laurikari and his work on tagged transitions[11]. This is the part we consider as our main contribution to the field. In the last chapter, chapter 7, we summarize by giving a regular expression matching algorithm using the previously discussed techniques. We also discuss related work by others."

The main goal of this work is application of TDFA to lexer generators that optimize for speed of the generated code. I suggest a number of practical improvements to Laurikari algorithm; notably, the use of one-symbol lookahead, which results in significant reduction of tag variables and operations on them. Experimental results confirm that lookahead-aware TDFA are considerably faster and usually smaller than baseline TDFA; and they are reasonably close in speed and size to ordinary DFA used for recognition of regular languages. The proposed algorithm can handle repeated submatch and therefore is applicable to full parsing. Furthermore, I examine the problem of disambiguation in the case of leftmost greedy and POSIX policies. I formalize POSIX disambiguation algorithm suggested by Kuklewicz and show that the resulting TDFA are as efficient as Laurikari TDFA or TDFA that use leftmost greedy disambiguation. All discussed algorithms are implemented in the open source lexer generator RE2C."

Let $A$ and $B$ be two $n \times n$-matrices over $\mathbb{L}$ that have the same characteristic polynomial. The main result of this paper states that the set $\left\{ A^0,A^1,A^2,\ldots\right\}$ is finite if and only if the set $\left\{ B^0,B^1,B^2,\ldots\right\}$ is finite. We apply this result to Cellular Automata (CA). Indeed, it gives a complete and easy-to-check characterization of sensitivity to initial conditions and equicontinuity for linear CA over the alphabet $\mathbb{K}^n$ for $\mathbb{K} = \mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ i.e., CA in which the local rule is defined by $n\times n$-matrices with elements in $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$. To prove our main result, we derive an integrality criterion for matrices that is likely of independent interest. Namely, let $\mathbb{K}$ be any commutative ring (not necessarily finite), and let $\mathbb{L}$ be a commutative $\mathbb{K}$-algebra. Consider any $n \times n$-matrix $A$ over $\mathbb{L}$. Then, $A \in \mathbb{L}^{n \times n}$ is integral over $\mathbb{K}$ (that is, there exists a monic polynomial $f \in \mathbb{K}\left[t\right]$ satisfying $f\left(A\right) = 0$) if and only if all coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of $A$ are integral over $\mathbb{K}$. The proof of this fact relies on a strategic use of exterior powers (a trick pioneered by Gert Almkvist). Furthermore, we extend the decidability result concerning sensitivity and equicontinuity to the wider class of additive CA over a finite abelian group. For such CA, we also prove the decidability of injectivity, surjectivity, topological transitivity and all the properties (as, for instance, ergodicity) that are equivalent to the latter."

These days, all big exchanges use computer algorithms that implement double sided auctions to match buy and sell requests and these algorithms must abide by certain regulatory guidelines. For example, market regulators enforce that a matching produced by exchanges should be \emph{fair}, \emph{uniform} and \emph{individual rational}. To verify these properties of trades, we first formally define these notions in a theorem prover and then give formal proofs of relevant results on matchings. Finally, we use this framework to verify properties of two important classes of double sided auctions. All the definitions and results presented in this paper are completely formalised in the Coq proof assistant without adding any additional axioms to it."

However, all these approaches either require defect datasets or bug-free source codes that are executable for training the deep learning model. Our neural network model is neither trained with any defect datasets nor bug-free programming source codes, instead it is trained using structural semantic details of Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) where each node represents a construct appearing in the source code. This model is implemented to fix one of the most common semantic errors, such as undeclared variable errors as well as infer their type information before program compilation. By this approach, the model has achieved in correctly locating and identifying 81% of the programs on prutor dataset of 1059 programs with only undeclared variable errors and also inferring their types correctly in 80% of the programs."

In this paper, we use Strictly k-Piecewise languages to generate datasets with various properties. We then compute the characteristics of the LDDs in these datasets using mutual information and analyze the impact of factors such as (i) k, (ii) length of LDDs, (iii) vocabulary size, (iv) forbidden subsequences, and (v) dataset size. This analysis reveal that the number of interacting elements in a dependency is an important characteristic of LDDs. This leads us to the challenge of modelling multi-element long-distance dependencies. Our results suggest that attention mechanisms in neural networks may aide in modeling datasets with multi-element long-distance dependencies. However, we conclude that there is a need to develop more efficient attention mechanisms to address this issue."

With existing methods, the time and space complexity of these two parts are still too expensive to be employed. So the process soon becomes totally incalculable with a slightly big size, which greatly limits its application. In this paper, we set out to solve these two problems using two efficient algorithms, which make it possible to solve reversible LCA of very large size. Furthermore, we provide an interesting perspective to conversely generate 1D LCA from a given period of reversibility. Due to our methods' efficiency, we can calculate the reversible LCA with large size, which has much potential to enhance security in cryptography system."

Their rigorous and formal characteristics make their learning them demanding. An important support for the assimilation of concepts is the possibility of interactively visualizing concrete examples of these computational models, facilitating understanding them.

This project aims at the development of an interactive web tool in Portuguese to help in an assisted and intuitive way to understand the concepts and algorithms in question, seeing them work step-by-step, through typical examples preloaded or built by the user (an original aspect of our platform). The tool should therefore enable the creation and edition of an automata, as well as execute the relevant classical algorithms such as word acceptance, model conversions, etc. It is also intended to visualize not only the process of construction of the automaton, but also all the steps of applying the given algorithm. This tool uses the Ocsigen Framework because it provides the development of complete and interactive web tools written in OCaml, a functional language with a strong type checking system and therefore perfect for a web page without errors. Ocsigen was also chosen because it allows the creation of dynamic pages with a singular client-server system. This article presents the first phase of the development of the project.

If such a game has deterministic winning strategies, one may ask how simple such strategies can get. The answer may help with actual implementation, or to win despite imperfect information, or to conceal sensitive information especially if the game is repeated. Given a concurrent two-player win/lose game of infinite duration, this article considers equivalence relations over histories of played actions. A classical restriction used here is that equivalent histories have equal length, hence \emph{time awareness}. A sufficient condition is given such that if a player has winning strategies, she has one that prescribes the same action at equivalent histories, hence \emph{uniformization}. The proof is fairly constructive and preserves finiteness of strategy memory, and counterexamples show relative tightness of the result. Several corollaries follow for games with states and colors."

HyperLTL has been successfully applied to express fundamental security policies like noninterference and observational determinism, but has also found applications beyond security, e.g., distributed protocols and coding theory. However, HyperLTL satisfiability is undecidable as soon as there are existential quantifiers in the scope of a universal one. To overcome this severe limitation to applicability, we investigate here restricted variants of the satisfiability problem to pinpoint the decidability border.   First, we restrict the space of admissible models and show decidability when restricting the search space to models of bounded size or to finitely representable ones. Second, we consider formulas with restricted nesting of temporal operators and show that nesting depth one yields decidability for a slightly larger class of quantifier prefixes. We provide tight complexity bounds in almost all cases."

Stream Runtime Verification (SRV) applies stream transformations to obtain information from observed traces. Incomplete traces with information missing in gaps pose a common challenge when applying RV and SRV techniques to real-world systems as RV approaches typically require the complete trace without missing parts. This paper presents a solution to perform SRV on incomplete traces based on abstraction. We use TeSSLa as specification language for non-synchronized timed event streams and define abstract event streams representing the set of all possible traces that could have occurred during gaps in the input trace. We show how to translate a TeSSLa specification to its abstract counterpart that can propagate gaps through the transformation of the input streams and thus generate sound outputs even if the input streams contain gaps and events with imprecise values. The solution has been implemented as a set of macros for the original TeSSLa and an empirical evaluation shows the feasibility of the approach.

A string attractor for a word $w=w[1]w[2]\cdots w[n]$ is a subset $\Gamma$ of the positions $\{1,\ldots,n\}$, such that all distinct factors of $w$ have an occurrence crossing at least one of the elements of $\Gamma$. While finding the smallest string attractor for a word is a NP-complete problem, it has been proved in [Kempa and Prezza, 2018] that dictionary compressors can be interpreted as algorithms approximating the smallest string attractor for a given word.   In this paper we explore the notion of string attractor from a combinatorial point of view, by focusing on several families of finite words. The results presented in the paper suggest that the notion of string attractor can be used to define new tools to investigate combinatorial properties of the words."

It is based on the insight that the collection of finite structures can be embedded, via a map they call the Stone pairing, in a space of measures, where the desired limits can be computed. We show that a closely related but finer grained space of measures arises --- via Stone-Priestley duality and the notion of types from model theory --- by enriching the expressive power of first-order logic with certain ``probabilistic operators''. We provide a sound and complete calculus for this extended logic and expose the functorial nature of this construction.   The consequences are two-fold. On the one hand, we identify the logical gist of the theory of structural limits. On the other hand, our construction shows that the duality-theoretic variant of the Stone pairing captures the adding of a layer of quantifiers, thus making a strong link to recent work on semiring quantifiers in logic on words. In the process, we identify the model theoretic notion of types as the unifying concept behind this link. These results contribute to bridging the strands of logic in computer science which focus on semantics and on more algorithmic and complexity related areas, respectively."

Commonly, in control applications such models are developed manually, hence, keeping them up-to-date requires extra effort. To simplify the maintenance process, an automatic approach may be used, allowing to infer models from behavior examples and temporal properties. As an example of a specific control systems development application we focus on inferring finite-state models of function blocks (FBs) defined by the IEC 61499 international standard for distributed automation systems. In this paper we propose a method for FB model inference from behavior examples based on reduction to Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT). Additionally, we take into account linear temporal properties using counterexample-guided synthesis. We also present the developed tool fbSAT which implements the proposed method, and evaluate it in two case studies: inference of a finite-state model of a Pick-and-Place manipulator, and reconstruction of randomly generated automata. In contrast to existing approaches, the suggested method is more efficient and produces finite-state models minimal both in terms of number of states and guard conditions complexity."

In a similar fashion, we introduce nonuniform state complexity classes using nonuniform families of quantum finite automata empowered by the flexible use of garbage tapes. We first present general inclusion and separation relationships among nonuniform state complexity classes of various one-way finite automata, including deterministic, nondeterministic, probabilistic, and quantum finite automata having polynomially many inner states. For two-way quantum finite automata equipped with flexible garbage tapes, we show a close relationship between the nonuniform state complexity of the family of such polynomial-size quantum finite automata and the parameterized complexity class induced by logarithmic-space quantum computation assisted by polynomial-size advice. We further establish a direct connection between space-bounded quantum computation with quantum advice and quantum finite automata whose transitions are dictated by superpositions of transition tables."

The reachability problem for this model is unfortunately undecidable. Therefore, we tackle this problem by introducing an abstraction framework based on Kleene algebras in order to compute an abstraction of the execution paths between two regular sets of configurations. We combine an automata theoretic saturation procedure with constraint solving in a finite domain. We then apply this framework to an iterative abstraction refinement scheme, using multiple abstractions of increasing complexity and precision."

The challenge is to alleviate the size explosion of the search space when considering networks of timed automata working in parallel. In the timed setting this explosion is particularly visible as even different interleavings of local actions of processes may lead to different zones. Salah et al. in 2006 have shown that the union of all these different zones is also a zone. This observation was used in an algorithm which from time to time detects and aggregates these zones into a single zone.   We show that such aggregated zones can be calculated more efficiently using the local time semantics and the related notion of local zones proposed by Bengtsson et al. in 1998. Next, we point out a flaw in the existing method to ensure termination of the local zone graph computation. We fix this with a new algorithm that builds the local zone graph and uses abstraction techniques over (standard) zones for termination. We evaluate our algorithm on standard examples. On various examples, we observe an order of magnitude decrease in the search space. On the other examples, the algorithm performs like the standard zone algorithm."

In this paper, we present a characterization of the bisimilarity distance as the solution of a simple stochastic game. The characterization gives us an algorithm to compute the distances by applying Condon's simple policy iteration on these games. The correctness of Condon's approach, however, relies on the assumption that the games are stopping. Our games may be non-stopping in general, yet we are able to prove termination for this extended class of games. Already other algorithms have been proposed in the literature to compute these distances, with complexity in $\textbf{UP} \cap \textbf{coUP}$ and \textbf{PPAD}. Despite the theoretical relevance, these algorithms are inefficient in practice. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first practical solution.   The characterization of the probabilistic bisimilarity distance mentioned above crucially uses a dual presentation of the Hausdorff distance due to M\'emoli. As an additional contribution, in this paper we show that M\'emoli's result can be used also to prove that the bisimilarity distance bounds the difference in the maximal (or minimal) probability of two states to satisfying arbitrary $\omega$-regular properties, expressed, eg., as LTL formulas."

On the other hand, restricting the number of clocks, the use of clocks (compared or not with the parameters), and the use of parameters (e.g. used only as upper or lower bounds) leads to decidability of some problems.

We address the problem of the existence of the amortized carry propagation in non-standard numeration systems of various kinds: abstract numeration systems, rational base numeration systems, greedy numeration systems and beta-numeration. We tackle the problem by three different types of techniques: combinatorial, algebraic, and ergodic.

We apply this theory to develop verification algorithms for memory safety--- determining if a heap-manipulating program that allocates and frees memory locations and manipulates heap pointers does not dereference an unallocated memory location. We show that this problem is decidable when the initial allocated heap forms a forest data-structure and when programs are streaming-coherent, which intuitively restricts programs to make a single pass over a data-structure. Our experimental evaluation on a set of library routines that manipulate forest data-structures shows that common single-pass algorithms on data-structures often fall in the decidable class, and that our decision procedure is efficient in verifying them."

Qualitative timed pattern matching is one of the mathematical formulations of monitoring, which gives a Boolean verdict for each sub-signal according to the satisfaction of the given specification. There are two orthogonal directions of extension of the qualitative timed pattern matching. One direction on the result is quantitative: what engineers want is often not a qualitative verdict but the quantitative measurement of the satisfaction of the specification. The other direction on the algorithm is online checking: the monitor returns some verdicts before obtaining the entire signal, which enables to monitor a running system. It is desired from application viewpoints. In this paper, we conduct these two extensions, taking an automata-based approach. This is the first quantitative and online timed pattern matching algorithm to the best of our knowledge. More specifically, we employ what we call timed symbolic weighted automata to specify quantitative specifications to be monitored, and we obtain an online algorithm using the shortest distance of a weighted variant of the zone graph and dynamic programming. Moreover, our problem setting is semiring-based and therefore, general. Our experimental results confirm the scalability of our algorithm for specifications with a time-bound."

Our algorithm works by reformulating the satisfiability of bounded word equations as a reachability problem for nondeterministic finite automata, and then carefully encoding this as a propositional satisfiability problem, which we then solve using the well-known Glucose SAT-solver. This approach has the advantage of allowing for the natural inclusion of additional linear length constraints. Our solver obtains reliable and competitive results and, remarkably, discovered several cases where state-of-the-art solvers exhibit a faulty behaviour."

While all deterministic automata are GFG, some nondeterministic automata are not. There are various other properties that are used in the literature for defining that a nondeterministic automaton is GFG, including ""history-deterministic"", ""compliant with some letter game"", ""good for trees"", and ""good for composition with other automata"". The equivalence of these properties has not been formally shown.   We generalize all of these definitions to alternating automata and show their equivalence. We further show that alternating GFG automata are as expressive as deterministic automata with the same acceptance conditions and indices. We then show that alternating GFG automata over finite words, and weak automata over infinite words, are not more succinct than deterministic automata, and that determinizing B\""uchi and co-B\""uchi alternating GFG automata involves a $2^{\Theta(n)}$ state blow-up. We leave open the question of whether alternating GFG automata of stronger acceptance conditions allow for doubly-exponential succinctness compared to deterministic automata."

To mitigate these perceptions, FSM, a library to program state machines and grammars, was developed to bring programming to the Automata Theory classroom. The results of the library's maiden voyage at Seton Hall University had a positive impact on students, but the students found the library difficult to use due to the error messages generated. These messages were generated by the host language meaning that students needed to be familiar with the library's implementation to make sense of them. This article presents the design of and results obtained from using an error-messaging system tailor-made for FSM. The effectiveness of the library was measured by both a control group study and a survey. The results strongly suggest that the error-messaging system has had a positive impact on students' attitude towards automata theory, towards programming in FSM, and towards FSM error messages. The consequence has been a marked improvement on students' ability to implement algorithms developed as part of constructive proofs by making the debugging of FSM programs easier."

We study approximate learning problems for limit-average automata in two settings: passive and active. In the passive learning case, we show that limit-average automata are not PAC-learnable as samples must be of exponential-size to provide (with good probability) enough details to learn an automaton. We also show that the problem of finding an automaton that fits a given sample is NP-complete. In the active learning case, we show that limit-average automata can be learned almost-exactly, i.e., we can learn in polynomial time an automaton that is consistent with the target automaton on almost all words. On the other hand, we show that the problem of learning an automaton that approximates the target automaton (with perhaps fewer states) is NP-complete. The abovementioned results are shown for the uniform distribution on words. We briefly discuss learning over different distributions."

Therefore, runtime verification is an appealing alternative. Logics for hyperproperties, such as HyperLTL, support a rich set of such properties. We first show that black-box monitoring of HyperLTL is in general unfeasible, and suggest a gray-box approach. Gray-box monitoring implies performing analysis of the system at run-time, which brings new limitations to monitorabiliy (the feasibility of solving the monitoring problem). Thus, as another contribution of this paper we refine the classic notions of monitorability, both for trace properties and hyperproperties, taking into account the computability of the monitor. We then apply our approach to monitor a privacy hyperproperty called distributed data minimality, expressed as a HyperLTL property, by using an SMT-based static verifier at runtime."

We show that synthesis of rational resynchronizers is decidable for functional, and even finite-valued, one-way transducers, and undecidable for relational one-way transducers. In the two-way setting, synthesis of regular resynchronizers is shown to be decidable for unambiguous two-way transducers. For larger classes of two-way transducers, the decidability status is open."

All works we do (talking, reasoning, seeing and etc) are computations performed by the universe-computer which runs the simulation program. Inspired by the view of the simulation hypothesis (but independent of this hypothesis), we propose a new method of logical reasoning named ""Computer-Simulation Model Theory"", CSMT. Computer-Simulation Model Theory is an extension of Mathematical Model Theory where instead of mathematical-structures, computer-simulations are replaced, and the activity of reasoning and computing of the reasoner is also simulated in the model. (CSMT) argues that:   For a formula $\phi$, construct a computer simulation model $S$, such that   1- $\phi$ does not hold in $S$, and   2- the reasoner $I$ $($human being, the one who lives inside the reality$)$ cannot distinguish $S$ from the reality $(R)$,   then $I$ cannot prove $\phi$ in reality.   Although $\mathrm{CSMT}$ is inspired by the simulation hypothesis, but this reasoning method is independent of the acceptance of this hypothesis. As we argue in this part, one may do not accept the simulation hypothesis, but knows $\mathrm{CSMT}$ a valid reasoning method. As an application of Computer-Simulation Model Theory, we study the famous problem P vs NP. We let $\phi \equiv\mathrm{ [P= NP]} $ and construct a computer simulation model $E$ such that $\mathrm{P= NP}$ does not hold in $E$."

The intreg-problem generalizes the idea of considering multiple instances at once and connects classical combinatorial problems with the field of automata theory. While the question of the decidability of the intreg-problem has been answered positively for several NP- and even PSPACE-complete problems, we are presenting natural problems even from L with an undecidable intreg-problem. We also discuss alphabet sizes and different encoding-schemes elaborating the boundary between problem-variants with a decidable respectively undecidable intreg-problem."

Model-theoretic approaches to formal language theory traditionally assume that each position in a string belongs to exactly one unary relation. We consider unconventional string models where positions can have multiple, shared properties, which are arguably useful in many applications. We show the structures given by these models are partially ordered, and present a learning algorithm that exploits this ordering relation to effectively prune the hypothesis space.

Unlike LSTMs, transformers process input sequences entirely through self-attention. Previous work has suggested that the computational capabilities of self-attention to process hierarchical structures are limited. In this work, we mathematically investigate the computational power of self-attention to model formal languages. Across both soft and hard attention, we show strong theoretical limitations of the computational abilities of self-attention, finding that it cannot model periodic finite-state languages, nor hierarchical structure, unless the number of layers or heads increases with input length. These limitations seem surprising given the practical success of self-attention and the prominent role assigned to hierarchical structure in linguistics, suggesting that natural language can be approximated well with models that are too weak for the formal languages typically assumed in theoretical linguistics."

2019-06-13 17:48:21+00:00,2019-06-13 17:48:21+00:00,"Reactive synthesis is a class of methods to construct a provably-correct control system, referred to as a robot, with respect to a temporal logic specification in the presence of a dynamic and uncontrollable environment. This is achieved by modeling the interaction between the robot and its environment as a two-player zero-sum game. However, existing reactive synthesis methods assume both players to have complete information, which is not the case in many strategic interactions. In this paper, we use a variant of hypergames to model the interaction between the robot and its environment; which has incomplete information about the specification of the robot. This model allows us to identify a subset of game states from where the robot can leverage the asymmetrical information to achieve a better outcome, which is not possible if both players have symmetrical and complete information. We then introduce a novel method of opportunistic synthesis by defining a Markov Decision Process (MDP) using the hypergame under temporal logic specifications. When the environment plays some stochastic strategy in its perceived sure-winning and sure-losing regions of the game, we show that by following the opportunistic strategy, the robot is ensured to only improve the outcome of the game - measured by satisfaction of sub-specifications - whenever an opportunity becomes available. We demonstrate the correctness and optimality of this method using a robot motion planning example in the presence of an adversary."

For a pair of monads modelling the branching and the linear type we defined regular maps that generalize regular languages known in classical non-deterministic automata theory. These maps are behaviours of certain automata (i.e. they possess a coalgebraic nature), yet they arise from Eilenberg-Moore algebras and their homomorphisms (by exploiting duality between the category of Eilenberg-Moore algebras and saturated coalgebras).   Given some additional assumptions, we show that regular maps form a certain subcategory of the Kleisli category for the monad which is the composition of the branching and linear type. Moreover, we state a Kleene-like theorem characterising the regular morphisms category in terms of the smallest subcategory closed under certain operations. Additionally, whenever the branching type monad is taken to be the powerset monad, we show that regular maps are described as maps recognized by certain functors whose codomains are categories with all finite hom-sets.   We instantiate our framework on classical non-deterministic automata, tree automata, fuzzy automata and weighted automata."

Then, ADTs are modelled as (an extension of) Asynchronous Multi-Agents Systems--EAMAS. The ADT-EAMAS transformation is performed in a systematic manner that ensures correctness. The transformation allows us to quantify the impact of different agents configurations on metrics such as attack time. Using EAMAS also permits parametric verification: we derive constraints for property satisfaction. Our approach is exercised on several case studies using the Uppaal and IMITATOR tools."

An operator observes a plant through a natural projection that hides the occurrence of certain events. The objective of the operator is that of estimating the current state of the system. The observation is corrupted by an attacker which can insert and erase some sensor readings with the aim of altering the state estimation of the operator. Furthermore, the attacker wants to remain stealthy, namely the operator should not realize that its observation has been corrupted. An automaton, called attack structure, is defined to describe the set of all possible attacks. In more details, first, an unbounded attack structure is obtained by concurrent composition of two state observers, the attacker observer and the operator observer. Then, the attack structure is refined to obtain a supremal stealthy attack substructure. An attack function may be selected from the supremal stealthy attack substructure and it is said harmful when some malicious goal of the attacker is reached, namely if the set of states consistent with the observation produced by the system and the set of states consistent with the corrupted observation belong to a given relation. The proposed approach can be dually used to verify if there exists a harmful attack for the given system: this allows one to establish if the system is safe under attack."

Using known results on borders, we get an asymptotic enumeration for the number of words having no even (resp., odd) palindromic prefix .

To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first study to introduce the shuffle languages to analyze the computational power of neural networks. We also show that a single-layer LSTM with only one hidden unit is practically sufficient for recognizing the Dyck-$1$ language. However, none of our recurrent networks was able to yield a good performance on the Dyck-$2$ language learning task, which requires a model to have a stack-like mechanism for recognition."

It combines two ideas: the first one is a construction used by D'Angeli, Rodaro and the first author to obtain an inverse automaton semigroup with a PSPACE-complete word problem and the second one is to utilize a construction used by Barrington to simulate circuits of bounded degree and logarithmic depth in the group of even permutations over five elements."

Membership of a semigroup to this class does not depend on the choice of the generators. These semigroups are rationally presented. Representatives may be computed in exponential time. Their word problem is decidable in exponential time. They enjoy a property similar to the so-called Lipschitz property, or fellow traveler property. If graded, they are automatic.

It is well known that this is a computationally hard task. Despite being rather straightforward that, ultimately, all such tasks can be formalized as constraints satisfaction problems, no unified approach to solving them was proposed so far, and very diverse ad-hoc methods were used. We aim to fill this gap: we show how several relevant avoidability problems can be modelled, and consequently solved, in an uniform way as constraint satisfaction problems, using the framework of MiniZinc. The main advantage of this approach is that one is now required only to formulate the avoidability problem in the MiniZinc language, and then the actual search for a solution does not have to be implemented ad-hoc, being instead carried out by a standard CSP-solver."

Besides the logical rules determining the evolution of each component with respect to the state of its regulators, the scheduling of component updates can have a dramatic impact on the predicted behaviours. In this paper, we explore the use of Read (contextual) Petri Nets (RPNs) to study dynamics of BNs from a concurrency theory perspective. After showing bi-directional translations between RPNs and BNs and analogies between results on synchronism sensitivity, we illustrate that usual updating modes for BNs can miss plausible behaviours, i.e., incorrectly conclude on the absence/impossibility of reaching specific configurations. We propose an encoding of BNs capitalizing on the RPN semantics enabling more behaviour than the generalized asynchronous updating mode. The proposed encoding ensures a correct abstraction of any multivalued refinement, as one may expect to achieve when modelling biological systems with no assumption on its time features."

The first extension integrates the popular CEGAR principle and the second extension allows us to analyze different cases in isolation.

In particular, the output length is polynomial in the input length, as opposed to MSO transductions, which have output of linear length. We show that string-to-string MSO interpretations are exactly the polyregular functions.

Hence, two total and strict spatial heap operations are proposed upon heap graphs, for conjunction and disjunction -- similar to logical conjuncts. Heap conjunction implies that there exists a free heap vertex to connect to or an explicit destination vertex is provided. Essentially, Burstall's properties do not change. By heap we refer to an arbitrary simple directed graph, which is finite and may contain composite vertices representing class objects. Arbitrary heap memory access is restricted, as well as type punning, late class binding and further restrictions. Properties of the new logic are investigated, and as a result group properties are shown. Both expecting and superficial heaps are specifiable. Equivalence transformations may make denotated heaps inconsistent, although those may be detected and patched by the two generic linear canonization steps presented. The properties help to motivate a later full introduction of a set of equivalences over heap for future work. Partial heaps are considered as a useful specification technique that help to reduce incompleteness issues with specifications. Finally, the logic proposed may be considered for extension for the Object Constraint Language."

In this paper, we investigate two aspects of the problem, namely prefix normal palindromes and so-called collapsing words (extending the notion of critical words). We prove characterizations for both the palindromes and the collapsing words and show their connection. Based on this, we show that still open problems regarding prefix normal words can be split into certain subproblems."

It is well known that the containment problem, i.e., the problem of deciding for two given register automata with guessing A and B, whether the language L(A) accepted by A is contained in the language L(B) accepted by B, is undecidable, even if B only uses a single register.

The safety verification problem for such programs is undecidable. We present in this paper a technique that combines queue-bounded exploration with a convergence test: if the sequence of certain abstractions of the reachable states, for increasing queue bounds k, converges, we can prove any property of the program that is preserved by the abstraction. If the abstract state space is finite, convergence is guaranteed; the challenge is to catch the point k_max where it happens. We further demonstrate how simple invariants formulated over the concrete domain can be used to eliminate spurious abstract states, which otherwise prevent the sequence from converging. We have implemented our technique for the P programming language for event-driven programs. We show experimentally that the sequence of abstractions often converges fully automatically, in hard cases with minimal designer support in the form of sequentially provable invariants, and that this happens for a value of k_max small enough to allow the method to succeed in practice."

They include stochastic acceptors, which represent certain probability distributions over random strings. We consider the problem of efficient sampling: drawing random string variates from the probability distribution represented by stochastic automata and transformations of those. We show that path-sampling is effective and can be efficient if the epsilon-graph of a finite automaton is acyclic. We provide an algorithm that ensures this by conflating epsilon-cycles within strongly connected components. Sampling is also effective in the presence of non-injective transformations of strings. We illustrate this in the context of decoding for Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC), where the predictive probabilities yield auxiliary sequences which are transformed into shorter labeling strings. We can sample efficiently from the transformed labeling distribution and use this in two different strategies for finding the most probable CTC labeling."

The proposed algorithm involves a counting step and a difference of convex optimization step, both of which can be performed efficiently. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach on various tasks, including distilling $n$-gram models from neural models, building compact language models, and building open-vocabulary character models.

It builds a term-based symbolic representation of the state space of the tree automaton (TA) constructed by the classical WSkS decision procedure. The classical decision procedure transforms the symbolic representation into a TA via a bottom-up traversal and then tests its language non-emptiness, which corresponds to satisfiability of the formula. On the other hand, we start evaluating the representation from the top, construct the state space on the fly, and utilize opportunities to prune away parts of the state space irrelevant to the language emptiness test. In order to do so, we needed to extend the notion of language terms (denoting language derivatives) used in our previous procedure for the linear fragment of the logic (the so-called WS1S) into automata terms. We implemented our decision procedure and identified classes of formulae on which our prototype implementation is significantly faster than the classical procedure implemented in the Mona tool."
2019-05-21 10:30:30+00:00,2019-05-21 10:30:30+00:00,"Computer systems can be found everywhere: in space, in our homes, in our cars, in our pockets, and sometimes even in our own bodies. For concerns of safety, economy, and convenience, it is important that such systems work correctly. However, it is a notoriously difficult task to ensure that the software running on computers behaves correctly.   One approach to ease this task is that of model checking, where a model of the system is made using some mathematical formalism. Requirements expressed in a formal language can then be verified against the model in order to give guarantees that the model satisfies the requirements.   For many computer systems, time is an important factor. As such, we need our formalisms and requirement languages to be able to incorporate real time.   We therefore develop formalisms and algorithms that allow us to compare and express properties about real-time systems. We first introduce a logical formalism for reasoning about upper and lower bounds on time, and study the properties of this formalism, including axiomatisation and algorithms for checking when a formula is satisfied.   We then consider the question of when a system is faster than another system. We show that this is a difficult question which can not be answered in general, but we identify special cases where this question can be answered. We also show that under this notion of faster-than, a local increase in speed may lead to a global decrease in speed, and we take step towards avoiding this.   Finally, we consider how to compare the real-time behaviour of systems not just qualitatively, but also quantitatively. Thus, we are interested in knowing how much one system is faster or slower than another system. This is done by introducing a distance between systems. We show how to compute this distance and that it behaves well with respect to certain properties."

Both description and specification sentences shall follow our well-defined structured natural language definition. TA models constructed from descriptions and temporal logic queries generated from specifications can be imported to UPPAAL, a verification tool for TA models. The goal is to accelerate the design phase for real-time systems by assisting the construction and verification of a formal model. We believe ATAC can be useful especially during the initial phases of the design process and help designers to avoid erroneous models."

Much work on the algorithmic learning of pattern languages has thus focussed on interesting subclasses of patterns for which positive learnability results may be achieved. A natural restriction on a pattern is a bound on its variable frequency -- the maximum number $m$ such that some variable occurs exactly $m$ times in the pattern. This paper examines the effect of limiting the variable frequency of all patterns belonging to a class $\Pi$ on the worst-case minimum number of labelled examples needed to uniquely identify any pattern of $\Pi$ in cooperative teaching-learning models. Two such models, the teaching dimension model as well as the preference-based teaching model, will be considered."

Although worst-case optimal, the procedure in many cases produces automata that are unnecessarily large. In this paper, we propose several ways of how to use the direct and delayed simulation relations to reduce the size of the automaton obtained in the rank-based complementation procedure. Our techniques are based on either (i) ignoring macrostates that cannot be used for accepting a word in the complement or (ii) saturating macrostates with simulation-smaller states, in order to decrease their total number. We experimentally showed that our techniques can indeed considerably decrease the size of the output of the complementation."

Yet, it enforces the overall coherence of the development artifacts (ranging from proofs over tests to code) by a particular environment (CVCE). In particular, the validation process is built around a formal development based on the interactive theorem proving system Isabelle/HOL, by linking the business logic of the application to the operating system model, down to code and concrete hardware models thanks to a series of refinement proofs. We apply both the process and its support in CVCE to a case-study that comprises a model of an odometric service in a railway-system with its corresponding implementation integrated in seL4 (a secure kernel for which a comprehensive Isabelle development exists). Novel techniques implemented in Isabelle enforce the coherence of semi-formal and formal definitions within specific certification processes in order to improve their cost-effectiveness .

For regular functions, we show that computability is equivalent to continuity, and therefore the problem boils down to deciding continuity. We establish a generic characterisation of continuity for functions preserving regular languages under inverse image (such as regular functions). We exploit this characterisation to show the decidability of continuity (and hence computability) of rational functions in \textsc{NLogSpace} (it was already known to be in \textsc{PTime} by Prieur), and of regular functions."

A configuration is a state and a value for each counter; a transition changes the state and each counter is incremented, decremented, or left unchanged. While qualitative properties such as state and configuration reachability have been studied for VASS, we consider the long-run average cost of infinite computations of VASS. The cost of a configuration is for each state, a linear combination of the counter values. In the special case of uniform cost functions, the linear combination is the same for all states. The (regular) long-run emptiness problem is, given a VASS, a cost function, and a threshold value, if there is a (lasso-shaped) computation such that the long-run average value of the cost function does not exceed the threshold. For uniform cost functions, we show that the regular long-run emptiness problem is (a)~decidable in polynomial time for integer-valued VASS, and (b)~decidable but nonelementarily hard for natural-valued VASS (i.e., nonnegative counters). For general cost functions, we show that the problem is (c)~NP-complete for integer-valued VASS, and (d)~undecidable for natural-valued VASS. Our most interesting result is for (c) integer-valued VASS with general cost functions, where we establish a connection between the regular long-run emptiness problem and quadratic Diophantine inequalities.

In this paper we study the reverse question to determinization. We will present a construction to associate succinct automata to languages based on different algebraic structures. For instance, for classical regular languages the construction will transform a deterministic automaton into a non-deterministic one, where the states represent the join-irreducibles of the language accepted by a (potentially) larger deterministic automaton.

If such an implementation $f$ exists, the procedure should also output $\mathcal{T}_f$. The realisability problem is the corresponding decision problem.   For specifications given by synchronous transducers (which read and write alternately one symbol), this is the finite variant of the classical synthesis problem on $\omega$-words, solved by B\""uchi and Landweber in 1969, and the realisability problem is known to be ExpTime-c in both finite and $\omega$-word settings. For specifications given by asynchronous transducers (which can write a batch of symbols, or none, in a single step), the realisability problem is known to be undecidable.   We consider here the class of multi-sequential specifications, defined as finite unions of sequential transducers over possibly incomparable domains. We provide optimal decision procedures for the realisability problem in both the synchronous and asynchronous setting, showing that it is PSpace-c. Moreover, whenever the specification is realisable, we expose the construction of a sequential transducer that realises it and has a size that is doubly exponential, which we prove to be optimal."

We consider different instances, depending on whether the specification is nondeterministic, universal or deterministic, and depending on whether the number of registers of the implementation is given or not.   In the unbounded setting, we show undecidability for both universal and nondeterministic specifications, while decidability is recovered in the deterministic case. In the bounded setting, undecidability still holds for nondeterministic specifications, but can be recovered by disallowing tests over input data. The generic technique we use to show the latter result allows us to reprove some known result, namely decidability of bounded synthesis for universal specifications."

Parsing Expressions Grammars (PEGs) are a formalism that naturally describes recursive top-down parsers using a restricted form of backtracking. Labeled failures are a conservative extension of PEGs that adds an error reporting mechanism for PEG parsers, and these labels can also be associated with recovery expressions to provide an error recovery mechanism. These expressions can use the full expressivity of PEGs to recover from syntactic errors.   Manually annotating a large grammar with labels and recovery expressions can be difficult. In this work, we present two approaches, Standard and Unique, to automatically annotate a PEG with labels, and to build their corresponding recovery expressions. The Standard approach annotates a grammar in a way similar to manual annotation, but it may insert labels incorrectly, while the Unique approach is more conservative to annotate a grammar and does not insert labels incorrectly.   We evaluate both approaches by using them to generate error recovering parsers for four programming languages: Titan, C, Pascal and Java. In our evaluation, the parsers produced using the Standard approach, after a manual intervention to remove the labels incorrectly added, gave an acceptable recovery for at least 70% of the files in each language. By it turn, the acceptable recovery rate of the parsers produced via the Unique approach, without the need of manual intervention, ranged from 41% to 76%."

However, the correctness of these statements is not supported by any verification technique or formal proof. In this paper, we propose using a formal model-based approach to overcome this issue.

For each MSO graph storage type, we define an MSO logic which is a subset of the usual MSO logic on graphs.

On the other side there is the Zielonka's recursive algorithm, which is very simple, exponential in the worst case, and the fastest in practice. We combine these two approaches: we propose a small modification of the Zielonka's algorithm, which ensures that the running time is at most quasi-polynomial. In effect, we obtain a simple algorithm that solves parity games in quasi-polynomial time. We also hope that our algorithm, after further optimizations, can lead to an algorithm that shares the good performance of the Zielonka's algorithm on typical inputs, while reducing the worst-case complexity on difficult inputs."

Monitoring high-speed computer networks (100 Gbps and faster) in a single-box solution demands that the RE matching, traditionally based on finite automata (FAs), is accelerated in hardware. In this paper, we describe a novel FPGA architecture for RE matching that is able to process network traffic beyond 100 Gbps. The key idea is to reduce the required FPGA resources by leveraging approximate nondeterministic FAs (NFAs). The NFAs are compiled into a multi-stage architecture starting with the least precise stage with a high throughput and ending with the most precise stage with a low throughput. To obtain the reduced NFAs, we propose new approximate reduction techniques that take into account the profile of the network traffic.

We show how to use the recently-introduced \emph{priority} operator to transform refinement questions in these models into trace refinement (language inclusion) tests. Furthermore, we are able to generalise this to any (rational) finite observational model.

Due to the dynamic nature of the surrounding world of these systems, assuring the satisfaction of their properties at runtime and in the presence of a change is important. A prominent approach to assure the correct behavior of these systems is verification at runtime, which has strict time and memory limitations. To tackle these limitations, we propose Magnifier, an iterative, incremental, and compositional verification approach that operates on a component-based model. The Magnifier idea is zooming on the component affected by a change, verifying the correctness of properties of interest of the system after adapting the component to the change, and then zooming out and tracing the change if it propagates. If the change propagates, all components affected by the change are adapted and are composed to form a new component. Magnifier repeats the same process for the new component. This iterative process terminates whenever the propagation of the change stops. In Magnifier, we use the Coordinated Adaptive Actor model (CoodAA) of traffic control systems. We present a formal semantics for CoodAA as a network of Timed Input-Output Automata (TIOAs). The change does not propagate if TIOAs of the adapted component and its environment are compatible. We implement our approach in Ptolemy II. The results of our experiments indicate that the proposed approach improves the verification time and the memory consumption compared to a non-compositional approach."

As main technical result it is proved that any such composition can be realized as a linear bounded composition, which means that the sizes of the intermediate results can be chosen to be at most linear in the size of the output tree. This has consequences for the expressiveness and complexity of the translations in the hierarchy. First, if the computed translation is a function of linear size increase, i.e., the size of the output tree is at most linear in the size of the input tree, then it can be realized by just one, deterministic, tree-walking tree transducer. For compositions of deterministic transducers it is decidable whether or not the translation is of linear size increase. Second, every composition of deterministic transducers can be computed in deterministic linear time on a RAM and in deterministic linear space on a Turing machine, measured in the sum of the sizes of the input and output tree. Similarly, every composition of nondeterministic transducers can be computed in simultaneous polynomial time and linear space on a nondeterministic Turing machine. Their output tree languages are deterministic context-sensitive, i.e., can be recognized in deterministic linear space on a Turing machine. The membership problem for compositions of nondeterministic translations is nondeterministic polynomial time and deterministic linear space. The membership problem for the composition of a nondeterministic and a deterministic tree-walking tree translation (for a nondeterministic IO macro tree translation) is log-space reducible to a context-free language, whereas the membership problem for the composition of a deterministic and a nondeterministic tree-walking tree translation (for a nondeterministic OI macro tree translation) is possibly NP-complete."

Many of these concepts naturally extend the classical automata and logics over words, which provide a framework for modeling sequential systems. A distributed system, on the other hand, combines several (finite or recursive) processes, and will therefore be modeled as a collection of (finite or pushdown, respectively) automata. A crucial parameter of a distributed system is the kind of interaction that is allowed between processes. In this lecture, we focus on the message-passing paradigm. In general, communication in a distributed system creates complex dependencies between events, which are hidden when using a sequential, operational semantics. The approach taken here is based on a faithful preservation of the dependencies of concurrent events. That is, an execution of a system is modeled as a partial order, or graph, rather than a sequence of events."

GVASes can weakly compute all fast growing functions $F_\alpha$ for $\alpha<\omega^\omega$, hence they are computationally more powerful than standard vector addition systems. On the other hand they cannot weakly compute the inverses $F_\alpha^{-1}$ or indeed any sublinear function. The proof relies on a pumping lemma for runs of GVASes that is of independent interest."
2019-04-05 20:23:03+00:00,2020-05-20 02:45:35+00:00,"In this work, we study the problem of supervisory control of discrete-event systems (DES) in the presence of attacks that tamper with inputs and outputs of the plant. We consider a very general system setup as we focus on both deterministic and nondeterministic plants that we model as finite state transducers (FSTs); this also covers the conventional approach to modeling DES as deterministic finite automata. Furthermore, we cover a wide class of attacks that can nondeterministically add, remove, or rewrite a sensing and/or actuation word to any word from predefined regular languages, and show how such attacks can be modeled by nondeterministic FSTs; we also present how the use of FSTs facilitates modeling realistic (and very complex) attacks, as well as provides the foundation for design of attack-resilient supervisory controllers. Specifically, we first consider the supervisory control problem for deterministic plants with attacks (i) only on their sensors, (ii) only on their actuators, and (iii) both on their sensors and actuators. For each case, we develop new conditions for controllability in the presence of attacks, as well as synthesizing algorithms to obtain FST-based description of such attack-resilient supervisors. A derived resilient controller provides a set of all safe control words that can keep the plant work desirably even in the presence of corrupted observation and/or if the control words are subjected to actuation attacks. Then, we extend the controllability theorems and the supervisor synthesizing algorithms to nondeterministic plants that satisfy a nonblocking condition. Finally, we illustrate applicability of our methodology on several examples and numerical case-studies."

The importance measures are then in turn used to obtain a criticality value for each system component and to rank the components in descending manner. Simulations tools are generally used to perform importance measure based analysis, but they require expensive computations and thus they are not suitable for large systems. A more scalable approach is to utilize the importance measures to obtain all the necessary conditions by proving a generic relationship describing the relative importance between any pair of components in a system. In this paper, we propose to use higher-order-logic (HOL) theorem proving to verify such relationships and thus making sure that all the essential conditions are accompanied by the proven property. In particular, we formalize the commonly used importance measures, such as Birnbaum and Fussell-Vesely, and conduct a formal importance measure analysis of a railway signaling system at a Moroccan level crossing as an application for illustration purpose."

Our approach relies on abstract interpretation and checks whether an overapproximating abstraction of $L_1$, obtained by overapproximating the Kleene iterates of its least fixpoint characterization, is included in $L_2$. We show that a language inclusion problem is decidable whenever this overapproximating abstraction satisfies a completeness condition (i.e., its loss of precision causes no false alarm) and prevents infinite ascending chains (i.e., it guarantees termination of least fixpoint computations). This overapproximating abstraction of languages can be defined using quasiorder relations on words, where the abstraction gives the language of all the words ""greater than or equal to"" a given input word for that quasiorder. We put forward a range of such quasiorders that allow us to systematically design decision procedures for different language inclusion problems such as regular languages into regular languages or into trace sets of one-counter nets, and context-free languages into regular languages. In the case of inclusion between regular languages, some of the induced inclusion checking procedures correspond to well-known state-of-the-art algorithms like the so-called antichain algorithms. Finally, we provide an equivalent language inclusion checking algorithm based on a greatest fixpoint computation that relies on quotients of languages and, to the best of our knowledge, was not previously known."

As a corollary, when a UC2RPQ is bounded, it is equivalent to a UCQ of at most triple-exponential size, and in fact we show that this bound is optimal. We also study better behaved classes of UC2RPQs, namely acyclic UC2RPQs of bounded thickness, and strongly connected UCRPQs, whose boundedness problem are, respectively, PSpace-complete and $\Pi^p_2$-complete.

The first problem that we consider is Liveness Verification. It asks whether there is a computation such that one of the clients visits a final state infinitely often. The complexity of the problem has been open since 2010 when it was shown to be P-hard and solvable in EXPSPACE. We close the gap by a polynomial-time algorithm. The algorithm relies on a characterization of live computations in terms of paths in a suitable graph, combined with a fixed-point iteration to efficiently check the existence of such paths. The second problem is Fair Liveness Verification. It asks for a computation where all participating clients visit a final state infinitely often. We adjust the algorithm to also solve fair liveness in polynomial time.   Both problems can be instrumented to answer model checking questions for broadcast networks against linear time temporal logic specifications. The first problem in this context is Fair Model Checking. It demands that for all computations of a broadcast network, all participating clients satisfy the specification. We solve the problem via the Vardi-Wolper construction and a reduction to Liveness Verification. The second problem is Sparse Model Checking. It asks whether each computation has a participating client that satisfies the specification. We reduce the problem to Fair Liveness Verification."

This is an exponential improvement on the translation of Kupferman and Vardi (2001) and a quasi-polynomial improvement on the translation of Boker and Lehtinen (2018). Any slightly better such translation would (if---like all presently known such translations---it is efficiently constructive) lead to algorithms for solving parity games that are asymptotically faster in the worst case than the current state of the art (Calude, Jain, Khoussainov, Li, and Stephan, 2017; Jurdzi\'nski and Lazi\'c, 2017; and Fearnley, Jain, Schewe, Stephan, and Wojtczak, 2017), and hence it would yield a significant breakthrough."

This problem is motivated by a recent method of embedding an R-independent language into one that is maximal R-independent, where the method requires to use an asymmetric partition of R. We solve the problem when R is realized by a zero-avoiding transducer (with some bound k): if the absolute value of the input-output length discrepancy of a computation exceeds k then the length discrepancy of the computation cannot become zero. This class of relations properly contains all recognizable, all left synchronous, and all right synchronous relations. We leave the asymmetric partition problem open when R is not realized by a zero-avoiding transducer. We also show examples of total wordorderings for which there is a relation R that cannot be partitioned into two asymmetric rational relations such that one of them is decreasing with respect to the given word-ordering."

A zigzag word is represented by an initial string, followed by a finite list of terms, each of which repeats for each $n \geq 1$ in one of three ways: it grows forward [$t(1)\ t(2)\ \dotsm\ t(n)]$, backward [$t(n)\ \dotsm\ t(2)\ t(1)$], or just occurs once [$t$]. Each term can recursively contain subterms with their own forward and backward repetitions. We show that an infinite word is morphic with growth $\Theta(n^k)$ iff it is a zigzag word of depth $k$. As corollaries, we obtain that the morphic words with growth $O(n)$ are exactly the ultimately periodic words, and the morphic words with growth $O(n^2)$ are exactly the multilinear words."

Our approach makes use of nominal Stone duality and a recent category theoretic generalization of Birkhoff-type HSP theorems that we instantiate here for the category of nominal sets. In addition, we prove an axiomatic characterization of weak pseudovarieties as those classes of orbit-finite monoids that can be specified by sequences of nominal equations, which provides a nominal version of a classical theorem of Eilenberg and Sch\""utzenberger."

The acceptance and rejection of a given input are determined by observing the interior system after the input is completely processed. Such automata naturally generalize one-way finite automata of various types, including deterministic, probabilistic, quantum, and pushdown automata. We examine the strengths and weaknesses of the power of this new automata model when recognizing formal languages. We investigate tantalizing effects of various topological features of our topological automata by analyzing their behaviors when different kinds of topological spaces and continuous maps, which are used respectively as configuration spaces and transition operators, are provided to the automata. Finally, we present goals and directions of future studies on the topological features of topological automata."

Moreover for every multi-head one way reversible finite automaton there exist a parallel communicating one-way reversible finite automata system which accepts the same language.

Can we, however, link the reversibility of finite CA to that of infinite CA? In order to address this issue, we introduce a new notion, named semi-reversibility. We classify the CAs into three types with respect to reversibility property -- reversible, semi-reversible and strictly irreversible. A tool, reachability tree, has been used to decide the reversibility class of any CA. Finally, relation among the existing cases of reversibility is established."

In the literature, there are various works done on how to automatically synthesize interpolants for decidable fragments of first-order logic, linear arithmetic, array logic, equality logic with uninterpreted functions (EUF), etc., and their combinations. But Craig interpolant generation for non-linear theory and its combination with the aforementioned theories are still in infancy, although some attempts have been done. In this paper, we first prove that a polynomial interpolant of the form $h(\mathbf{x})>0$ exists for two mutually contradictory polynomial formulas $\phi(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$ and $\psi(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})$, with the form $f_1\ge0\wedge\cdots\wedge f_n\ge0$, where $f_i$ are polynomials in $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}$ or $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z}$, and the quadratic module generated by $f_i$ is Archimedean. Then, we show that synthesizing such interpolant can be reduced to solving a semi-definite programming problem (${\rm SDP}$). In addition, we propose a verification approach to assure the validity of the synthesized interpolant and consequently avoid the unsoundness caused by numerical error in ${\rm SDP}$ solving. Finally, we discuss how to generalize our approach to general semi-algebraic formulas."

In fact, their expressive power coincide with relations definable in a universal automatic structure; equivalently, those definable by finite set interpretations in WS1S (Weak Second Order Theory of One Successor). Determining whether a regular relation admits a recognizable relation was known to be decidable (and in exponential time for binary relations), but its precise complexity still hitherto remains open. Our main contribution is to fully settle the complexity of this decision problem by developing new techniques employing infinite Ramsey theory. The complexity for DFA (resp. NFA) representations of regular relations is shown to be NLOGSPACE-complete (resp. \PSPACE-complete)."

Such queries consider a regular expression r and a directed edge-labeled graph G and search for paths in G for which the sequence of labels is in the language of r. In order to avoid having to consider infinitely many paths, some database engines restrict such paths to be trails, that is, they only consider paths without repeated edges. In this paper we consider the evaluation problem for RPQs under trail semantics, in the case where the expression is fixed. We show that, in this setting, there exists a trichotomy. More precisely, the complexity of RPQ evaluation divides the regular languages into the finite languages, the class Ttract (for which the problem is tractable), and the rest. Interestingly, the tractable class in the trichotomy is larger than for the trichotomy for simple paths, discovered by Bagan, Bonifati, and Groz [PODS 2013]. In addition to this trichotomy result, we also study characterizations of the tractable class, its expressivity, the recognition problem, closure properties, and show how the decision problem can be extended to the enumeration problem, which is relevant to practice."

In fact, we prove a generalization of this result, which can be applied to show that finitely generated subgroups and subsemigroups as well as principal left ideals of automaton semigroups are infinite if and only if there is an $\omega$ -word with an infinite orbit under their action. The proof also shows some interesting connections between the automaton semigroup and its dual. Finally, our result is interesting from an algorithmic perspective as it allows for a reformulation of the finiteness problem for automaton groups and semigroups."

Sequential transducers, which have a deterministic behaviour regarding their input, are of particular interest. However, unlike finite-state automata, not every transducer can be made sequential. The seminal work of Choffrut allows to characterise, amongst the functional one-way transducers, the ones that admit an equivalent sequential transducer. In this work, we extend the results of Choffrut to the class of transducers that produce their output string by adding simultaneously, at each transition, a string on the left and a string on the right of the string produced so far. We call them the string-to-context transducers. We obtain a multiple characterisation of the functional string-to-context transducers admitting an equivalent sequential one, based on a Lipschitz property of the function realised by the transducer, and on a pattern (a new twinning property). Last, we prove that given a string-to-context transducer, determining whether there exists an equivalent sequential one is in coNP."

This article presents a third, independent approach to solving parity games in quasi-polynomial time, based on the notion of register game, a parameterised variant of a parity game. The analysis of register games leads to a quasi-polynomial algorithm for parity games, a polynomial algorithm for restricted classes of parity games and a novel measure of complexity, the register index, which aims to capture the combined complexity of the priority assignement and the underlying game graph.   We further present a translation of alternating parity word automata into alternating weak automata with only a quasi-polynomial increase in size, based on register games; this improves on the previous exponential translation.   We also use register games to investigate the parity index hierarchy: while for words the index hierarchy of alternating parity automata collapses to the weak level, and for trees it is strict, for structures between trees and words, it collapses logarithmically, in the sense that any parity tree automaton of size n is equivalent, on these particular classes of structures, to an automaton with a number of priorities logarithmic in n."

Specifically, we train a RNN on positive and negative examples from a regular language, and ask if there is a simple decoding function that maps states of this RNN to states of the minimal deterministic finite automaton (MDFA) for the language. Our experiments show that such a decoding function indeed exists, and that it maps states of the RNN not to MDFA states, but to states of an {\em abstraction} obtained by clustering small sets of MDFA states into ""superstates"". A qualitative analysis reveals that the abstraction often has a simple interpretation. Overall, the results suggest a strong structural relationship between internal representations used by RNNs and finite automata, and explain the well-known ability of RNNs to recognize formal grammatical structure."

Symbolic finite automata (SFAs) are finite automata whose transitions are labeled by predicates over a Boolean algebra, in which a big collection of characters leading the same transition may be represented by a single predicate. Residual finite automata (RFAs) are a special type of non-deterministic finite automata which can be exponentially smaller than the minimum deterministic finite automata and have a favorable property for learning algorithms. RSFAs have both properties of SFAs and RFAs and can have more succinct representation of transitions and fewer states than RFAs and deterministic SFAs accepting the same language. The implementation of our algorithm efficiently learns RSFAs over a huge alphabet and outperforms an existing learning algorithm for deterministic SFAs. The result also shows that the benefit of non-determinism in efficiency is even larger in learning SFAs than non-symbolic automata."

This enables to decide injectivity and surjectivity for linear HOCA of size memory $n$ over $\mathbb{Z}_m$ using the decidable characterization provided in [2] and [19] for injectivity and surjectivity of LCA over $\mathbb{Z}^n_m$.

What distinguishes our algorithm is its clean mathematical formulation: parsing is expressed as a composition of simple operations on languages and relations, and can therefore be implemented using only immutable data structures. With a proper choice of these structures, a vast majority of operations performed during parsing typical programming languages can be memoized, which allows our proof-of-concept implementation to outperform common generalized parsing algorithms, in some cases by orders of magnitude."

Formal verification provides ways of establishing correctness guarantees, which can be quite important for such safety-critical applications. But since PLC code does not include an analytic model of the system plant, their verification is limited to discrete properties. In this paper, we, thus, start the other way around with hybrid programs that include continuous plant models in addition to discrete control algorithms. Even deep correctness properties of hybrid programs can be formally verified in the theorem prover KeYmaera X that implements differential dynamic logic, dL, for hybrid programs. After verifying the hybrid program, we now present an approach for translating hybrid programs into PLC code. The new tool, HyPLC, implements this translation of discrete control code of verified hybrid program models to PLC controller code and, vice versa, the translation of existing PLC code into the discrete control actions for a hybrid program given an additional input of the continuous dynamics of the system to be verified. This approach allows for the generation of real controller code while preserving, by compilation, the correctness of a valid and verified hybrid program. PLCs are common cyber-physical interfaces for safety-critical industrial control applications, and HyPLC serves as a pragmatic tool for bridging formal verification of complex cyber-physical systems at the algorithmic level of hybrid programs with the execution layer of concrete PLC implementations."

2019-02-13 15:44:43+00:00,2019-02-13 15:44:43+00:00,"Concatenation hierarchies are classifications of regular languages. All such hierarchies are built through the same construction process: start from an initial class of languages and build new levels using two generic operations. Concatenation hierarchies have gathered a lot of interest since the 70s, thanks to an alternate logical definition: each concatenation hierarchy is the quantification alternation hierarchy within a variant of first-order logic over words.   Our goal is to understand such hierarchies. We look at two decision problems: membership and separation. For a class of languages C, C-separation takes two regular languages as input and asks whether there exists a third one in C including the first one and disjoint from the second one. Settling whether separation is decidable for the levels within a given concatenation hierarchy is among the most fundamental and challenging questions in formal language theory. In all prominent cases, it is open, or answered positively for low levels only. Recently, a breakthrough was made using a generic approach for a specific kind of hierarchy: those with a finite basis. In this case, separation is always decidable for levels 1/2, 1 and 3/2.   Our main theorem is similar but independent: we consider hierarchies with possibly infinite bases, but that may only contain group languages. An example is the quantifier alternation hierarchy of first-order logic with modular predicates: its basis consists of languages counting the length of words modulo some number. Using a generic approach, we show that for any such hierarchy, if separation is decidable for the basis, then it is decidable for levels up to 3/2. This complements the aforementioned result nicely: all bases considered in the literature are either finite or made of group languages. Thus, one may handle the lower levels of any prominent hierarchy in a generic way."

The elimination of private variables enables the usage of SMG off-the-shelf model checkers to implement HIGs. Furthermore, we demonstrate how a DAG can be decomposed into subgames that can be independently explored, utilizing parallel computation to reduce the model checking time, while alleviating the state space explosion problem that SMGs are notorious for. In addition, we propose a DAG-based framework for strategy synthesis and analysis.

Unlike exhaustive model checking, SMC works based on drawing samples from the system at hand and evaluate the specification with statistical confidence. The main benefit of applying SMC over exhaustive techniques is its efficiency and scalability. To reason about probabilistic hyperproperties, we first propose the temporal logic HyperPCLT* that extends PCTL* and HyperPCTL. We show that HyperPCLT* can express important probabilistic information-flow security policies that cannot be expressed with HyperPCTL. Then, we introduce SMC algorithms for verifying HyperPCLT* formulas on discrete-time Markov chains, based on sequential probability ratio tests (SPRT) with a new notion of multi-dimensional indifference region. Our SMC algorithms can handle both non-nested and nested probability operators for any desired significance level. To show the effectiveness of our technique, we evaluate our SMC algorithms on four case studies focused on information security: timing side-channel vulnerability in encryption, probabilistic anonymity in dining cryptographers, probabilistic noninterference of parallel programs, and the performance of a randomized cache replacement policy that acts as a countermeasure against cache flush attacks."

They also gave a procedure for deciding equivalence of transducer in the latter class. Here, we reconsider this equivalence problem. We present a new alternative decision procedure and prove that it runs in polynomial time. We also consider extensions of this result to partial transducers and to the case where parameters of transducers accumulate strings instead of trees."

The components communicate by executing interactions which are simultaneous atomic state changes of a set of components. We specify both the type of interactions (e.g.\ rendez-vous, broadcast) and the topology (i.e.\ architecture) of the system (e.g.\ pipeline, ring) via a decidable interaction logic, which is embedded in the classical weak sequential calculus of one successor (WS1S). Proving correctness of such system for safety properties, such as deadlock freedom or mutual exclusion, requires the inference of an inductive invariant that subsumes the set of reachable states and avoids the unsafe states. Our method synthesizes such invariants directly from the formula describing the interactions, without costly fixed point iterations. We applied our technique to the verification of several textbook examples, such as dining philosophers, mutual exclusion protocols and concurrent systems with preemption and priorities."

A different, less known determinization construction was derived by Muller and Schupp and appears to be unrelated to Safra's construction on the first sight. In this paper we propose a new meta-construction from nondeterministic B\""uchi to deterministic parity automata which strictly subsumes both the construction of Safra and the construction of Muller and Schupp. It is based on a correspondence between structures that are encoded in the macrostates of the determinization procedures - Safra trees on one hand, and levels of the split-tree, which underlies the Muller and Schupp construction, on the other. Our construction allows for combining the mentioned constructions and opens up new directions for the development of heuristics."

Up to now, session type disciplines have assumed that the communication medium is reliable, with no loss of messages. However, unreliable broadcast communication is common in a wide class of distributed systems such as ad-hoc and wireless sensor networks. Often such systems have structured communication patterns that should be amenable to analysis by means of session types, but the necessary theory has not previously been developed. We introduce the Unreliable Broadcast Session Calculus, a process calculus with unreliable broadcast communication, and equip it with a session type system that we show is sound. We capture two common operations, broadcast and gather, inhabiting dual session types. Message loss may lead to non-synchronised session endpoints. To further account for unreliability we provide with an autonomous recovery mechanism that does not require acknowledgements from session participants. Our type system ensures soundness, safety, and progress between the synchronised endpoints within a session. We demonstrate the expressiveness of our framework by implementing Paxos, the textbook protocol for reaching consensus in an unreliable, asynchronous network."

C\^{a}mpeanu and Ho (2004) have shown more generally that the tight upper bound for $\Sigma$ of cardinality $k$ and for complete automata is \[   \frac{k^r-1}{k-1} + \sum_{j=0}^{n-r}(2^{k^j}-1) + 1 \] where $r=\min\{m:k^m\ge 2^{k^{n-m}}-1\}$.

C\^{a}mpeanu and Ho's result can be viewed as concerning functions $f:[k]^n\to [2]$ where $[k]=\{0,\dots,k-1\}$ is a set of cardinality $k$. We generalize their result to arbitrary function $f:[k]^n\to [c]$ where $c$ is a positive integer.

In order to define the dynamics associated to a Boolean network, there are several \emph{update schemes} that range from parallel or \emph{synchronous} to \emph{asynchronous.} However, studying each possible dynamics defined by different update schemes might not be efficient. In this context, considering some type of temporal delay in the dynamics of Boolean networks emerges as an alternative approach. In this paper, we focus in studying the effect of a particular type of delay called \emph{firing memory} in the dynamics of Boolean networks. Particularly, we focus in symmetric (non-directed) conjunctive networks and we show that there exist examples that exhibit attractors of non-polynomial period. In addition, we study the prediction problem consisting in determinate if some vertex will eventually change its state, given an initial condition.

These models are useful for determining the expressive power and boundaries of various computational features. In light of the current state of quantum computation theory research, a systematic review of the literature seems timely. This article seeks to provide a comprehensive and systematic analysis of quantum finite automata models, quantum finite automata models with density operators and quantum finite automata models with classical states, interactive proof systems, quantum communication complexity and query complexity as described in the literature.

The translation is enabled by using MONA, a powerful tool for symbolic, BDD-based, DFA construction from logic specifications. Recent works used a first-order encoding of LTLf formulas to translate LTLf to First Order Logic (FOL), which is then fed to MONA to get the symbolic DFA. This encoding was shown to perform well, but other encodings have not been studied. Specifically, the natural question of whether second-order encoding, which has significantly simpler quantificational structure, can outperform first-order encoding remained open.   In this paper we address this challenge and study second-order encodings for LTLf formulas. We first introduce a specific MSO encoding that captures the semantics of LTLf in a natural way and prove its correctness. We then explore is a Compact MSO encoding, which benefits from automata-theoretic minimization, thus suggesting a possible practical advantage. To that end, we propose a formalization of symbolic DFA in second-order logic, thus developing a novel connection between BDDs and MSO. We then show by empirical evaluations that the first-order encoding does perform better than both second-order encodings. The conclusion is that first-order encoding is a better choice than second-order encoding in LTLf-to-Automata translation."

We present various complexity-related properties of unavoidable words. For words that are unavoidable, we provide an upper bound to the lengths of words that avoid them. A natural subsequent question is how many unavoidable words there are. We show that the fraction of words that are unavoidable drops exponentially fast in the length of the word. This allows us to calculate an upper bound on the number of unavoidable patterns for any given finite alphabet. Subsequently, we investigate computational aspects of unavoidable words. In particular, we exhibit concrete algorithms for determining whether a word is unavoidable. We also prove results on the computational complexity of the problem of determining whether a given word is unavoidable."

It permits to synthesize system controllers that exhibit acceptable behaviors within a configurable time frame, all along their infinite execution, in contrast to the traditional objectives that only require correctness of behaviors in the limit. The window concept has proved its interest in a variety of two-player zero-sum games because it enables reasoning about such time bounds in system specifications, but also thanks to the increased tractability that it usually yields.   In this work, we extend the window framework to stochastic environments by considering Markov decision processes. A fundamental problem in this context is the threshold probability problem: given an objective it aims to synthesize strategies that guarantee satisfying runs with a given probability. We solve it for the usual variants of window objectives, where either the time frame is set as a parameter, or we ask if such a time frame exists. We develop a generic approach for window-based objectives and instantiate it for the classical mean-payoff and parity objectives, already considered in games.

We show both models to be Turing complete exclusively based on their capacity to compute and access internal dense representations of the data. In particular, neither the Transformer nor the Neural GPU requires access to an external memory to become Turing complete. Our study also reveals some minimal sets of elements needed to obtain these completeness results."

By a theorem of McNaughton and Papert, these are also the first-order definable languages. The dot-depth rose to prominence following the work of Thomas, who proved an exact correspondence with the quantifier alternation hierarchy of first-order logic: each level in the dot-depth hierarchy consists of all languages that can be defined with a prescribed number of quantifier blocks. One of the most famous open problems in automata theory is to settle whether the membership problem is decidable for each level: is it possible to decide whether an input regular language belongs to this level?   Despite a significant research effort, membership by itself has only been solved for low levels. A recent breakthrough was achieved by replacing membership with a more general problem: separation. Given two input languages, one has to decide whether there exists a third language in the investigated level containing the first language and disjoint from the second. The motivation is that: (1) while more difficult, separation is more rewarding (2) it provides a more convenient framework (3) all recent membership algorithms are reductions to separation for lower levels.   We present a separation algorithm for dot-depth two. While this is our most prominent application, our result is more general. We consider a family of hierarchies that includes the dot-depth: concatenation hierarchies. They are built via a generic construction process. One first chooses an initial class, the basis, which is the lowest level in the hierarchy. Further levels are built by applying generic operations. Our main theorem states that for any concatenation hierarchy whose basis is finite, separation is decidable for level one. In the special case of the dot-depth, this can be lifted to level two using previously known results."

The great advantage of synthesis is that the resulting implementation is correct by construction; therefore there is no need for manual programming and tedious debugging tasks. Developers remain, nevertheless, hesitant to using automatic synthesis tools and still favor manually writing code. A common argument against synthesis is that the resulting implementation does not always give a clear picture on what decisions were made during the synthesis process. The outcome of synthesis tools is mostly unreadable and hinders the developer from understanding the functionality of the resulting implementation. Many attempts have been made in the last years to make the synthesis process more transparent to users. Either by structuring the outcome of synthesis tools or by providing additional automated support to help users with the specification process. In this paper we discuss the challenges in writing specifications for reactive systems and give a survey on what tools have been developed to guide users in specifying reactive systems and understanding the outcome of synthesis tools."

Furthermore, our formalization provides means for reasoning about the relationships between individual notions which have mostly been considered independently in prior work; and allows us to judge the appropriateness of the different definitions for various applications in system design.

We analyze such infinite counterexamples and identify the relevant ordered occurrences of causal events, obtained by unfolding the looping part of the lasso shaped counterexample sufficiently many times.

In this paper, I propose sequential networks for online monitoring applications and construct network-based monitors from the past fragment of MTL over discrete and dense time behaviors. This class of monitors is more compositional, extensible, and easily implementable than other monitors based on rewriting and automata. I first explain the sequential network construction over discrete time behaviors and then extend it towards dense time by adopting a point-free approach. The formulation for dense time behaviors and MTL radically differs from the traditional pointy definitions and in return, we avoid some longstanding complications. I argue that the point-free approach is more natural and practical therefore should be preferred for the dense time. Finally, I present my implementation together with some experimental results that show the performance of the network-based monitors compared to similar existing tools."

In certain cases, specifically when the local update is additive, powerful techniques may be brought to bear, including characteristic polynomials, the ergodic theorem with Fourier analysis, and endomorphisms of compact Abelian groups. For general dynamics, though, where such analytics generically do not apply, behavior-driven analysis shows great promise in directly monitoring the emergence of structure and complexity in cellular automata. Here we detail a surprising connection between generalized symmetries in the spacetime fields of configuration orbits as revealed by the behavior-driven local causal states, invariant sets of spatial configurations, and additive subdynamics which allow for closed-form analytic methods."

A sliding window algorithm for a language $L$ receives a stream of symbols and has to decide at each time step whether the suffix of length $n$ belongs to $L$ or not. The window size $n$ is either a fixed number (in the fixed-size model) or can be controlled by an adversary in a limited way (in the variable-size model). The main result of this paper states that for every visibly pushdown language the space complexity in the variable-size sliding window model is either constant, logarithmic or linear in the window size. This extends previous results for regular languages."

The crucial case is the case of the binary alphabet, analyzed in the central part of the paper.   The obtained ""transition property"", together with the developed technique, allowed us to solve cube-free versions of three old open problems by Restivo and Salemi. Besides, it has some further implications for combinatorics on words; e.g., it implies the existence of infinite cube-free words of very big subword (factor) complexity."

Then, in discrete-time rounds all nodes simultaneously update their color following a predefined deterministic rule. This process is called two-way $r$-bootstrap percolation, for some integer $r$, if a node with at least $r$ black neighbors gets black and white otherwise. Similarly, in two-way $\alpha$-bootstrap percolation, for some $0<\alpha<1$, a node gets black if at least $\alpha$ fraction of its neighbors are black, and white otherwise. The two aforementioned processes are called respectively $r$-bootstrap and $\alpha$-bootstrap percolation if we require that a black node stays black forever. For each of these processes, we say a node set $D$ is a dynamic monopoly whenever the following holds: If all nodes in $D$ are black then the graph gets fully black eventually. We provide tight upper and lower bounds on the minimum size of a dynamic monopoly."

After linear time preprocessing (in the input tree), we can enumerate answers with linear delay (in each answer). We allow updates on the tree to take place at any time, and we can then restart the enumeration after logarithmic time in the tree. Further, all our combined complexities are polynomial in the automaton.   Our result follows our previous circuit-based enumeration algorithms based on deterministic tree automata, and is also inspired by our earlier result on words and nondeterministic sequential extended variable-set automata in the context of document spanners. We extend these results and combine them with a recent tree balancing scheme by Niewerth, so that our enumeration structure supports updates to the underlying tree in logarithmic time (with leaf insertions, leaf deletions, and node relabelings). Our result implies that, for MSO queries with free first-order variables, we can enumerate the results with linear preprocessing and constant-delay and update the underlying tree in logarithmic time, which improves on several known results for words and trees.   Building on lower bounds from data structure research, we also show unconditionally that up to a doubly logarithmic factor the update time of our algorithm is optimal. Thus, unlike other settings, there can be no algorithm with constant update time."

We prove that this problem remains undecidable for parametric event-recording automata (PERAs), a subclass of PTAs that considerably restrains the way the language can be used; we also show it remains undecidable even for slightly different definitions of the language, i.e., finite sequences of actions ending in or passing infinitely often through accepting locations, or just all finite untimed words (without accepting locations)."

In this paper, we address the problem of identifying a union of languages from examples that belong to several different unknown languages. Indeed, decomposing a language into smaller pieces that are easier to represent should make learning easier than aiming for a too generalized language. In particular, we consider k-testable languages in the strict sense (k-TSS). These are defined by a set of allowed prefixes, infixes (sub-strings) and suffixes that words in the language may contain. We establish a Galois connection between the lattice of all languages over alphabet {\Sigma}, and the lattice of k-TSS languages over {\Sigma}. We also define a simple metric on k-TSS languages. The Galois connection and the metric allow us to derive an efficient algorithm to learn the union of k-TSS languages.

In particular, it is studied here the class of languages whose indicator functions allow the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm to output a monochromatic result, beyond the trivial case z = 0 for constant indicator functions. To illustrate examples of randomly balanced languages and some monochromatic cases, it was performed classical computational simulations of the Deutsch-Jozsa quantum algorithm for the specific cases of 4 and 6 qubits, respectively. The general case of the Deutsch-Jozsa decided languages are named balanced languages, and their outcomes from the simulation suggest that such languages are equivalent to the quantum superposition of the monochromatic cases."

This definition is motivated by the question which {\omega}-words admit infinite orbits: for such a word, every prefix is expandable.   In this paper, we show that, on input of a word u, an automaton T and a number k, it is decidable to check whether u is k-expandable with respect to the action of T. In fact, this can be done in exponential nondeterministic space. From this nondeterministic algorithm, we obtain a bound on the length of a potential orbit-increasing suffix x. Moreover, we investigate the situation if the automaton is invertible and generates a group. In this case, we give an algebraic characterization for the expandability of a word based on its shifted stabilizer. We also give a more efficient algorithm to decide expandability of a word in the case of automaton groups, which allows us to improve the upper bound on the maximal orbit-increasing suffix length. Then, we investigate the situation for reversible (and complete) automata and obtain that every word is expandable with respect to these automata. Finally, we give a lower bound example for the length of an orbit-increasing suffix."

For example, the areas of specification discovery and specification mining are concerned with measuring the consistency between a collection of execution traces and a program specification. This problem is also tackled in process mining with the help of measures that describe the quality of a process specification automatically discovered from execution logs. Though various measures have been proposed, it was recently demonstrated that they neither fulfil essential properties, such as monotonicity, nor can they handle infinite behaviour. In this paper, we address this research problem by introducing a new framework for the definition of behavioural quotients. We proof that corresponding quotients guarantee desired properties that existing measures have failed to support. We demonstrate the application of the quotients for capturing precision and recall measures between a collection of recorded executions and a system specification. We use a prototypical implementation of these measures to contrast their monotonic assessment with measures that have been defined in prior research."
2018-12-17 22:13:33+00:00,2019-02-04 19:04:26+00:00,"We study the computational complexity of solving mean payoff games. This class of games can be seen as an extension of parity games, and they have similar complexity status: in both cases solving them is in $\textbf{NP} \cap \textbf{coNP}$ and not known to be in $\textbf{P}$. In a breakthrough result Calude, Jain, Khoussainov, Li, and Stephan constructed in 2017 a quasipolynomial time algorithm for solving parity games, which was quickly followed by two other algorithms with the same complexity. Our objective is to investigate how these techniques can be extended to the study of mean payoff games.   The starting point is the notion of separating automata, which has been used to present all three quasipolynomial time algorithms for parity games and gives the best complexity to date. The notion naturally extends to mean payoff games and yields a class of algorithms for solving mean payoff games. The contribution of this paper is to prove tight bounds on the complexity of algorithms in this class. We construct two new algorithms for solving mean payoff games. Our first algorithm depends on the largest weight $N$ (in absolute value) appearing in the graph and runs in sublinear time in $N$, improving over the previously known linear dependence in $N$. Our second algorithm runs in polynomial time for a fixed number $k$ of weights.   We complement our upper bounds by providing in both cases almost matching lower bounds, showing the limitations of the separating automata approach. We show that we cannot hope to improve on the dependence in $N$ nor break the linear dependence in the exponent in the number $k$ of weights. In particular, this shows that separating automata do not yield a quasipolynomial algorithm for solving mean payoff games."

This concept is implicitly present in the verification of qualitative systems, and is more pronounced in the verification of quantitative systems. In this work, we identify a novel mode of comparison in quantitative systems: the online comparison of the aggregate values of two sequences of quantitative weights. This notion is embodied by {\em comparator automata} ({\em comparators}, in short), a new class of automata that read two infinite sequences of weights synchronously and relate their aggregate values.   We show that {aggregate functions} that can be represented with B\""uchi automaton result in comparators that are finite-state and accept by the B\""uchi condition as well. Such {\em $\omega$-regular comparators} further lead to generic algorithms for a number of well-studied problems, including the quantitative inclusion and winning strategies in quantitative graph games with incomplete information, as well as related non-decision problems, such as obtaining a finite representation of all counterexamples in the quantitative inclusion problem.   We study comparators for two aggregate functions: discounted-sum and limit-average. We prove that the discounted-sum comparator is $\omega$-regular iff the discount-factor is an integer. Not every aggregate function, however, has an $\omega$-regular comparator. Specifically, we show that the language of sequence-pairs for which limit-average aggregates exist is neither $\omega$-regular nor $\omega$-context-free. Given this result, we introduce the notion of {\em prefix-average} as a relaxation of limit-average aggregation, and show that it admits $\omega$-context-free comparators."

Where the synchronizing words of the \v{C}ern\'y automata $\mathcal{C}_n$ have switch count linear in $n$, we wonder whether synchronizing automata exist for which every synchronizing word has quadratic switch count. The answer is positive: we prove that switch count has the same complexity as synchronizing word length. We give some series of synchronizing automata yielding quadratic switch count, the best one reaching $\frac{2}{3} n^2 + O(n)$ as switch count.   We investigate all binary automata on at most 9 states and determine the maximal possible switch count. For all $3\leq n\leq 9$, a strictly higher switch count can be reached by allowing more symbols. This behaviour differs from length, where for every $n$, no automata are known with higher synchronization length than $\mathcal{C}_n$, which has only two symbols. It is not clear if this pattern extends to larger $n$. For $n\geq 12$, our best construction only has two symbols."

We show that PAs can implement the BKA semantics of series-parallel rational expressions, and that a class of PAs can be translated back to these expressions. We also characterise the behavior of general PAs in terms of context-free pomset grammars; consequently, universality, equivalence and series-parallel rationality of general PAs are undecidable."

From a lattice theoretic point of view, the difference hierarchy over a bounded distributive lattice stratifies the Boolean algebra generated by it according to the minimum length of difference chains required to describe the Boolean elements. While each Boolean element is given by a finite difference chain, there is no canonical such writing in general. We show that, relative to the filter completion, or equivalently, the lattice of closed upsets of the dual Priestley space, each Boolean element over the lattice has a canonical minimum length decomposition into a Hausdorff difference. As a corollary each Boolean element over a (co-)Heyting algebra has a canonical difference chain. With a further generalization of this result involving a directed family of adjunctions with meet-semilattices, we give an elementary proof of the fact that a regular language is given by a Boolean combination of purely universal sentences using arbitrary numerical predicates if and only if it is given by a Boolean combination of purely universal sentences using only regular numerical predicates."

Desired motion specifications are formulated as Signal Temporal Logic (STL), whereas the communication performances to be optimized are captured by recently proposed Spatial Temporal Reach and Escape Logic (STREL) formulas. Both the STL and STREL specifications are encoded as mixed integer linear constraints posed on the system and/or environment state variables of the mobile robot network, where satisfactory control strategies can be computed by exploiting a distributed model predictive control (MPC) approach. To the best of the authors' knowledge, we are the first to study controller synthesis for STREL specifications.

More precisely, we identify the conditions under which each of these spans gives rise to a morphism into the respective power or Vietoris construction of the corresponding structure. Combining these characterizations, we obtain such a characterization for spans of Boolean spaces with internal semigroups which we use to describe the topo-algebraic counterpart of monadic second-order existential quantification. This is closely related to a part of the earlier work on existential quantification in first-order logic on words by Gehrke, Petri\c san and Reggio.

The above construction provides path-categories and trace semantics for free for different flavours of transition systems: (1) non-deterministic tree automata (2) regular nondeterministic nominal automata (RNNA), an expressive automata notion living in nominal sets (3) multisorted transition systems.

These patterns generalize square and palindromic factors of DOWs, respectively. We introduce a notion of inserting repeat/return words into DOWs and study how two distinct insertions into the same word can produce equivalent DOWs. Given a DOW $w$, we characterize the structure of $w$ which allows two distinct insertions to yield equivalent DOWs. This characterization depends on the locations of the insertions and on the length of the inserted repeat/return words and implies that when one inserted word is a repeat word and the other is a return word, then both words must be trivial (i.e., have only one symbol). The characterization also introduces a method to generate families of words recursively."

First, we show that the class of semigroups generated by partial automata coincides with the class of semigroups generated by complete automata if and only if the latter class is closed under removing a previously adjoined zero, which is an open problem in (complete) automaton semigroup theory stated by Cain. Then, we show that no semidirect product (and, thus, also no direct product) of an arbitrary semigroup with a (non-trivial) subsemigroup of the free monogenic semigroup is an automaton semigroup. Finally, we concentrate on inverse semigroups generated by invertible but partial automata, which we call automaton-inverse semigroups, and show that any inverse automaton semigroup can be generated by such an automaton (showing that automaton-inverse semigroups and inverse automaton semigroups coincide)."

The local memory of each process is represented by a finite-state controller and a fixed number of registers, each of which can store the unique identifier of some process in the network. To underline the naturalness of our model, we show that it has the same expressive power as a certain extension of first-order logic on graphs whose nodes are equipped with a total order. Said extension lets us define new functions on the set of nodes by means of a so-called partial fixpoint operator. In spirit, our result bears close resemblance to a classical theorem of descriptive complexity theory that characterizes the complexity class PSPACE in terms of partial fixpoint logic (a proper superclass of the logic we consider here)."

A recent study shows that the patients' death rate can be reduced by computerizing medical guidelines. Most existing medical guideline models are validated and/or verified based on the assumption that all necessary medical resources needed for a patient care are always available. However, the reality is that some medical resources, such as special medical equipment or medical specialists, can be temporarily unavailable for an individual patient. In such cases, safety properties validated and/or verified in existing medical guideline models without considering medical resource availability may not hold any more. The paper argues that considering medical resource availability is essential in building verifiably correct executable medical guidelines. We present an approach to explicitly and separately model medical resource availability and automatically integrate resource availability models into an existing statechart-based computerized medical guideline model. This approach requires minimal change in existing medical guideline models to take into consideration of medical resource availability in validating and verifying medical guideline models. A simplified stroke scenario is used as a case study to investigate the effectiveness and validity of our approach."

A recent study shows that the patients' death rate is significantly reduced by computerizing medical best practice guidelines. Recent data also show that some morbidity and mortality in emergency care are directly caused by delayed or interrupted treatment due to lack of medical resources. However, medical guidelines usually do not provide guidance on medical resource demands and how to manage potential unexpected delays in resource availability. If medical resources are temporarily unavailable, safety properties in existing executable medical guideline models may fail which may cause increased risk to patients under care. The paper presents a separately model and jointly verify (SMJV) architecture to separately model medical resource available times and relationships and jointly verify safety properties of existing medical best practice guideline models with resource models being integrated in. The SMJV architecture allows medical staff to effectively manage medical resource demands and unexpected resource availability delays during emergency care. The separated modeling approach also allows different domain professionals to make independent model modifications, facilitates the management of frequent resource availability changes, and enables resource statechart reuse in multiple medical guideline models. A simplified stroke scenario is used as a case study to investigate the effectiveness and validity of the SMJV architecture. The case study indicates that the SMJV architecture is able to identify unsafe properties caused by unexpected resource delays."

The main contribution of this paper is a PSPACE algorithm for computing the minimum possible regret of a given game. To this end, several results of independent interest are shown. (1) We identify a class of regret-minimizing and admissible strategies that first assume that the environment is collaborating, then assume it is adversarial---the precise timing of the switch is key here.

The answer is useful for optimising resource allocation for system defence. Given a set of safety requirements, we quantify the attacker capability in terms of the set of safety requirements an attacker can compromise. Given a system (in the presence of an attacker), model checking it against each safety requirement one by one is expensive and wasteful since the same state space is explored many times. We thus propose model checking multiple properties efficiently by means of coalgebraic model checking using enhanced coinduction techniques. We apply the proposed technique to a real-world water treatment system and the results show that our approach can effectively reduce the effort required for model checking."

From this hypothesis, it naturally follows that the degree-3 directed graph connectivity problem (3DSTCON) parameterized by the number of vertices in a given graph cannot belong to PsubLIN, composed of all parameterized decision problems computable by polynomial-time, sub-linear-space deterministic Turing machines. This hypothesis immediately implies L$\neq$NL and it was used as a solid foundation to obtain new lower bounds on the computational complexity of various NL search and NL optimization problems. The state complexity of transformation refers to the cost of converting one type of finite automata to another type, where the cost is measured in terms of the increase of the number of inner states of the converted automata from that of the original automata. We relate the linear space hypothesis to the state complexity of transforming restricted 2-way nondeterministic finite automata to computationally equivalent 2-way alternating finite automata having narrow computation graphs. For this purpose, we present state complexity characterizations of 3DSTCON and PsubLIN. We further characterize a nonuniform version of the linear space hypothesis in terms of the state complexity of transformation."

Intuitively, this notion of distance measures the degree of fault-tolerance exhibited by a candidate system. In practice, there are different kinds of fault-tolerance, here we restrict ourselves to the analysis of masking fault-tolerance because it is often a highly desirable goal for critical systems. Roughly speaking, a system is masking fault-tolerant when it is able to completely mask the faults, not allowing these faults to have any observable consequences for the users. We capture masking fault-tolerance via a simulation relation, which is accompanied by a corresponding game characterization. We enrich the resulting games with quantitative objectives to define the notion of masking fault-tolerance distance. Furthermore, we investigate the basic properties of this notion of masking distance, and we prove that it is a directed pseudo metric. We have implemented our approach in a prototype tool that automatically compute the masking distance between a nominal system and a fault-tolerant version of it. We have used this tool to measure the masking tolerance of multiple instances of several case studies"

Formal synthesis methods derived from symbolic systems have great potential for reasoning about high-level locomotion decisions and achieving complex maneuvering behaviors with correctness guarantees. This study takes a first step toward formally devising an architecture composed of task planning and control of whole-body dynamic locomotion behaviors in constrained and dynamically changing environments. At the high level, we formulate a two-player temporal logic game between the multi-limb locomotion planner and its dynamic environment to synthesize a winning strategy that delivers symbolic locomotion actions. These locomotion actions satisfy the desired high-level task specifications expressed in a fragment of temporal logic. Those actions are sent to a robust finite transition system that synthesizes a locomotion controller that fulfills state reachability constraints. This controller is further executed via a low-level motion planner that generates feasible locomotion trajectories. We construct a set of dynamic locomotion models for legged robots to serve as a template library for handling diverse environmental events. We devise a replanning strategy that takes into consideration sudden environmental changes or large state disturbances to increase the robustness of the resulting locomotion behaviors. We formally prove the correctness of the layered locomotion framework guaranteeing a robust implementation by the motion planning layer. Simulations of reactive locomotion behaviors in diverse environments indicate that our framework has the potential to serve as a theoretical foundation for intelligent locomotion behaviors."

These categorical interpretations make certain assumptions about the nature of natural languages that, when stated formally, may be seen to impose strong restrictions on pregroup grammars for natural languages.   We formalize this as a hypothesis about the form that pregroup models of natural languages must take, and demonstrate by an artificial language example that these restrictions are not imposed by the pregroup axioms themselves. We compare and contrast the artificial language examples with natural languages (using Welsh, a language where the 'noun' type cannot be taken as primitive, as an illustrative example).   The hypothesis is simply that there must exist a causal connection, or information flow, between the words of a sentence in a language whose purpose is to communicate information. This is not necessarily the case with formal languages that are simply generated by a series of 'meaning-free' rules. This imposes restrictions on the types of pregroup grammars that we expect to find in natural languages; we formalize this in algebraic, categorical, and graphical terms.   We take some preliminary steps in providing conditions that ensure pregroup models satisfy these conjectured properties, and discuss the more general forms this hypothesis may take."

A (symbolic) path is a finite sequence of assignments and assertions (i.e. without loops), and checking its feasibility amounts to determining the existence of inputs that yield a successful execution.   We give two general semantic conditions which together ensure the decidability of path feasibility: (1) each assertion admits regular monadic decomposition, and (2) each assignment uses a (possibly nondeterministic) function whose inverse relation preserves regularity. We show these conditions are expressive since they are satisfied by a multitude of string operations. They also strictly subsume existing decidable string theories, and most existing benchmarks (e.g. most of Kaluza's, and all of SLOG's, Stranger's, and SLOTH's). We give a simple decision procedure and an extensible architecture of a string solver in that a user may easily incorporate his/her own string functions. We show the general fragment has a tight, but high complexity. To address this, we propose to allow only partial string functions (i.e., prohibit nondeterminism) in condition (2). When nondeterministic functions are needed, we also provide a syntactic fragment that provides a support of nondeterministic functions but can be reduced to an existing solver SLOTH.   We provide an efficient implementation of our decision procedure for deterministic partial string functions in a new string solver OSTRICH. It provides built-in support for concatenation, reverse, functional transducers, and replaceall and provides a framework for extensibility to support further string functions. We demonstrate the efficacy of our new solver against other competitive solvers."

Indeed, one may want to access the part of the memory that is below the current stack or base pointer, hence the need for a model that keeps track of this part of the memory.   To this end, we introduce pushdown systems with an upper stack (UPDSs), an extension of PDSs where symbols popped from the stack are not destroyed but instead remain just above its top, and may be overwritten by later push rules. We prove that the sets of successors post* and predecessors pre* of a regular set of configurations of such a system are not always regular, but that post* is context-sensitive, so that we can decide whether a single configuration is forward reachable or not.   In order to under-approximate pre* in a regular fashion, we consider a bounded-phase analysis of UPDSs, where a phase is a part of a run during which either push or pop rules are forbidden. We then present a method to over-approximate post* that relies on regular abstractions of runs of UPDSs. Finally, we show how these approximations can be used to detect stack overflows and stack pointer manipulations with malicious intent."

An additional feature of the obfuscated supervisor, if it exists, is that it has exactly the minimum number of states among the set of all the resilient and behavior-preserving supervisors. Our approach involves a simple combination of two basic ideas: 1) a formulation of the problem of computing behavior-preserving supervisors as the problem of computing separating finite state automata under controllability and observability constraints, which can be efficiently tackled by using modern SAT solvers, and 2) the use of a recently proposed technique for the verification of attackability in our setting, with a normality assumption imposed on both the actuator attackers and supervisors."

To cope with this limitation, we develop an abstraction refinement semi-algorithm based on lazy annotation of the symbolic execution paths with interpolants, obtained by applying (i) quantifier elimination with witness term generation and (ii) Lyndon interpolation in the quantifier-free data theory with uninterpreted predicate symbols. This provides a method for checking inclusion of timed and finite-memory register automata, and emptiness of quantified predicate automata, previously used in the verification of parameterized concurrent programs, composed of replicated threads, with a shared-memory communication model."

For such words, the operation of multiplication by integers and division by $6$ are defined as the column multiplication and division in base 6 numerical system. The paper develops a finite automata approach for analysis of sequences $\left (\left \lfloor \xi \left (\frac{3}{2} \right)^n \right \rfloor \right)_{n \in {\mathbb Z}}$ for the words $\xi \in {\mathbb Z}^{\pm \omega}_{6}$ that have some common properties with $Z$-numbers in Mahler's $3/2$-problem. Such sequence of $Z$-words written under each other with the same digit positions in the same column is an infinite $2$-dimensional word over the alphabet ${\mathbb Z}_6$. The automata representation of the columns in the integer part of $2$-dimensional $Z$-words has the nice structural properties of the de Bruijn graphs. This way provides some sufficient conditions for the emptiness of the set of $Z$-numbers. Our approach has been initially inspirated by the proposition 2.5 in [1] where authors applies cellular automata for analysis of $\left(\left\{\xi\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^n\right\} \right)_{n\in{\mathbb Z}}$, $\xi\in{\mathbb R}$."

A recent study shows that the patients' death rate can be significantly reduced by computerizing medical best practice guidelines. To facilitate the development of computerized medical best practice guidelines, statecharts are often used as a modeling tool because of their high resemblances to disease and treatment models and their capabilities to provide rapid prototyping and simulation for clinical validations. However, some implementations of statecharts, such as Yakindu statecharts, are priority-based and have synchronous execution semantics which makes it difficult to model certain functionalities that are essential in modeling medical guidelines, such as two-way communications and configurable execution orders. Rather than introducing new statechart elements or changing the statechart implementation's underline semantics, we use existing basic statechart elements to design model patterns for the commonly occurring issues. In particular, we show the design of model patterns for two-way communications and configurable execution orders and formally prove the correctness of these model patterns. We further use a simplified airway laser surgery scenario as a case study to demonstrate how the developed model patterns address the two-way communication and configurable execution order issues and their impact on validation and verification of medical safety properties."

We describe an incremental determinisation construction on NFAs, which can be more efficient than the full powerset determinisation, depending on the width of the input NFA. This construction can be generalised to infinite words, and is particularly well-suited to coB\""uchi automata. For coB\""uchi automata, this procedure can be used to compute either a deterministic automaton or a GFG one, and it is algorithmically more efficient in the last case. We show this fact by proving that checking whether a coB\""uchi automaton is determinisable by pruning is NP-complete. On finite or infinite words, we show that computing the width of an automaton is EXPTIME-complete. This implies EXPTIME-completeness for multipebble simulation games on NFAs."

We then introduce a fragment of cLTL+, called counting linear temporal logic (cLTL), and show that a solution to planning problem with cLTL constraints can be obtained more efficiently if all robots have identical dynamics. In the second part of the paper, we relax the synchrony assumption and discuss how to generate trajectories that can be asynchronously executed, while preserving the satisfaction of the desired cLTL+ specification.

In particular, we obtain a special instance of Reiterman's theorem for pseudo-varieties.

In order to improve the timing aspects of a model, it is necessary to have some notion of what it means for a process to be faster than another, which can guide the stepwise refinement of the model. To this end we study a faster-than relation for semi-Markov decision processes and compare it to standard notions for relating systems. We consider the compositional aspects of this relation, and show that the faster-than relation is not a precongruence with respect to parallel composition, hence giving rise to so-called parallel timing anomalies. We take the first steps toward understanding this problem by identifying decidable conditions sufficient to avoid parallel timing anomalies in the absence of non-determinism."

These automatic sequences can be viewed as generalizations of the more typical $k$-automatic sequences and Pisot-automatic sequences. We show that, like $k$-automatic sequences, Parry-automatic sequences have sublinear factor complexity while there exist Bertrand-automatic sequences with superlinear factor complexity. We prove that the set of Parry-automatic sequences with respect to a fixed Parry numeration system is not closed under taking images by uniform substitutions or periodic deletion of letters. These closure properties hold for $k$-automatic sequences and Pisot-automatic sequences, so our result shows that these properties are lost when generalizing to Parry numeration systems and beyond. Moreover, we show that a multidimensional sequence is $U$-automatic with respect to a positional numeration system $U$ with regular language of numeration if and only if its $U$-kernel is finite."

It derives partial-correctness properties with all-path semantics (a state satisfying a given precondition reaches states satisfying a given postcondition on all terminating execution paths). The proof system takes as axioms any unconditional operational semantics, and is sound (partially correct) and (relatively) complete, independent of the object language. The soundness has also been mechanized in Coq. This approach is implemented in a tool for semantics-based verification as part of the K framework (http://kframework.org)"

We show that when the randomized procedure is too simple the exponent of the generated sets is O(n log n) with high probability, thus the procedure fails to return DFAs with large reset threshold. We extend this result to random nondeterministic automata (NDFAs) by showing, in particular, that a uniformly sampled NDFA has both a 2-directing word and a 3-directing word of length O(n log n) with high probability. We then present a more involved randomized algorithm that manages to generate DFAs with large reset threshold and we finally leverage this finding for exhibiting new families of DFAs with reset threshold of order $ \Omega(n^2/4) $."

Mathematically, the monitoring problem can be formalized as a pattern matching problem against a pattern automaton. Motivated by the needs in embedded applications---especially the limited channel capacity between a sensor unit and a processor that monitors---we pursue the idea of filtering as preprocessing for monitoring. Technically, for a given pattern automaton, we present a construction of a Moore machine that works as a filter. The construction is automata-theoretic, and we find the use of Moore machines particularly suited for embedded applications, not only because their sequential operation is relatively cheap but also because they are amenable to hardware acceleration by dedicated circuits. We prove soundness (i.e., absence of lost matches), too. We work in two settings: in the untimed one, a pattern is an NFA; in the timed one, a pattern is a timed automaton. The extension of our untimed construction to the timed setting is technically involved, but our experiments demonstrate its practical benefits."

For a class C, C-separation takes two regular languages as input and asks whether there exists a third language in C which includes the first and is disjoint from the second. First, in contrast with the situation for the classical membership problem, we prove that for most classes C, the complexity of C-separation does not depend on how the input languages are represented: it is the same for nondeterministic finite automata and monoid morphisms. Then, we investigate specific classes belonging to finitely based concatenation hierarchies. It was recently proved that the problem is always decidable for levels 1/2 and 1 of any such hierarchy (with inefficient algorithms). Here, we build on these results to show that when the alphabet is fixed, there are polynomial time algorithms for both levels. Finally, we investigate levels 3/2 and 2 of the famous Straubing-Th\'erien hierarchy. We show that separation is PSPACE-complete for level 3/2 and between PSPACE-hard and EXPTIME for level 2."

These are like the regular string-to-string functions, except that they can have polynomial (and not just linear) growth. The class has four equivalent definitions: 1. deterministic two-way transducers with pebbles; 2 the smallest class of string-to-string functions that is closed under composition, contains all sequential functions as well as two extra functions called squaring and iterated reverse 3. a fragment of the lambda-calculus, which has a list type constructor and limited forms of iteration such as map but not fold; 4. an imperative programming language, which has for loops that range over input positions.   The first definition comes from [milo2003typechecking], while the remaining three are new to the author's best knowledge. The class of polyregular functions contains known classes of string-to-string transducers, such as the sequential, rational, or regular ones, but goes beyond them because of super-linear growth. Polyregular functions have good algorithmic properties, such as: - the output can be computed in linear time (in terms of combined input and output size); - the inverse image of a regular word language is (effectively) regular.   We also identify a fragment of polyregular functions, called the first-order polyregular functions, which has additional good properties, e.g. the output can be computed by an AC0 circuit."

We then consider three particular automata models (finite automata, transducers and automata weighted by integers -- sum-automata --) and instantiate the generic logic for each of them. We give tight complexity results for the three logics and the model-checking problem, depending on whether the formula is fixed or not. We study the expressiveness of our logics by expressing classical structural patterns characterising for instance finite ambiguity and polynomial ambiguity in the case of finite automata, determinisability and finite-valuedness in the case of transducers and sum-automata. Consequently to our complexity results, we directly obtain that these classical properties can be decided in PTIME."
2018-10-08 12:15:45+00:00,2019-04-24 12:39:24+00:00,"Nielsen, Plotkin, and Winskel (1981) proved that every 1-safe Petri net $N$ unfolds into an event structure $\mathcal{E}_N$. By a result of Thiagarajan (1996 and 2002), these unfoldings are exactly the trace regular event structures. Thiagarajan (1996 and 2002) conjectured that regular event structures correspond exactly to trace regular event structures. In a recent paper (Chalopin and Chepoi, 2017, 2018), we disproved this conjecture, based on the striking bijection between domains of event structures, median graphs, and CAT(0) cube complexes. On the other hand, in Chalopin and Chepoi (2018) we proved that Thiagarajan's conjecture is true for regular event structures whose domains are principal filters of universal covers of (virtually) finite special cube complexes.   In the current paper, we prove the converse: to any finite 1-safe Petri net $N$ one can associate a finite special cube complex ${X}_N$ such that the domain of the event structure $\mathcal{E}_N$ (obtained as the unfolding of $N$) is a principal filter of the universal cover $\widetilde{X}_N$ of $X_N$. This establishes a bijection between 1-safe Petri nets and finite special cube complexes and provides a combinatorial characterization of trace regular event structures.   Using this bijection and techniques from graph theory and geometry (MSO theory of graphs, bounded treewidth, and bounded hyperbolicity) we disprove yet another conjecture by Thiagarajan (from the paper with S. Yang from 2014) that the monadic second order logic of a 1-safe Petri net is decidable if and only if its unfolding is grid-free.   Our counterexample is the trace regular event structure $\mathcal{\dot E}_Z$ which arises from a virtually special square complex $\dot Z$. The domain of $\mathcal{\dot E}_Z$ is grid-free (because it is hyperbolic), but the MSO theory of the event structure $\mathcal{\dot E}_Z$ is undecidable."

A trace language is level-regular if the set of Foata normal forms of its elements is regular. We prove that the rewriting graph of a RTL is word-automatic. Thus its first-order theory is decidable. Then, we prove that the concurrent unfolding of a finite concurrent automaton with the reachability relation is a RTL graph. It follows that the first-order theory with the reachability predicate (FO[Reach] theory) of such an unfolding is decidable. It is known that this property holds also for the ground term rewriting graphs. We provide examples of finite concurrent automata of which the concurrent unfoldings fail to be ground term rewriting graphs. The infinite grid tree (for each vertex of an infinite grid, there is an edge from this vertex to the origin of a copy of the infinite grid) is such an unfolding. We prove that the infinite grid tree is not a ground term rewriting graph. We have thus obtained a new class of graphs for with a decidable FO[Reach] theory."

A submonoid $M$ generated by $k$ elements of $A^*$ is $k$-maximal if there does not exist another submonoid generated by at most $k$ words containing $M$. We call a set $X \subseteq A^*$ primitive if it is the basis of a $|X|$-maximal submonoid. This extends the notion of primitive word: indeed, $\{w\}$ is a primitive set if and only if $w$ is a primitive word.   By definition, for any set $X$, there exists a primitive set $Y$ such that $X \subseteq Y^*$. The set $Y$ is therefore called a primitive root of $X$. As a main result, we prove that if a set has rank $2$, then it has a unique primitive root. This result cannot be extended to sets of rank larger than 2.   For a single word $w$, we say that the set $\{x,y\}$ is a {\em binary root} of $w$ if $w$ can be written as a concatenation of copies of $x$ and $y$ and $\{x,y\}$ is a primitive set. We prove that every primitive word $w$ has at most one binary root $\{x,y\}$ such that $|x|+|y|<\sqrt{|w|}$. That is, the binary root of a word is unique provided the length of the word is sufficiently large with respect to the size of the root.   Our results are also compared to previous approaches that investigate pseudo-repetitions, where a morphic involutive function $\theta$ is defined on $A^*$. In this setting, the notions of $\theta$-power, $\theta$-primitive and $\theta$-root are defined, and it is shown that any word has a unique $\theta$-primitive root. This result can be obtained with our approach by showing that a word $w$ is $\theta$-primitive if and only if $\{w, \theta(w)\}$ is a primitive set."

The goodness of $\Aa$ gives a very easy proof for the forest factorization theorem, providing a Ramsey split for any word in $\Sigma^{\infty}$ such that the height of the Ramsey split is bounded by the number of states of A. An important application of synthesizing good automata from the morphim $\varphi$ is in the construction of regular transducer expressions (RTE) corresponding to deterministic two way transducers."

The aim of this paper is to give an algorithmic procedure to study the growth of such automata groups, and more precisely to provide numerical upper bounds on their exponents. Our functions retrieve known optimal bounds on the famous first Grigorchuk group. They also improve known upper bounds on other automata groups and permitted us to discover several new examples of automata groups of intermediate growth.

This space is infinite, because there is no halting algorithm for L-grammars; but it is also subjected to hard conditions, because there are grammars and developments which are not possible states of an L-system: a very well-known example is the space of normal grammars. Just as the space of normal grammars is parametrized into Regular, Context-Free, Context-Sensitive, and Unrestricted (with proper containment relations holding among them; see Chomsky, 1959: Theorem 1), we contend here that the L-space is a very rich landscape of grammars which cluster into kinds that are not mutually translatable."

Syntactic structure is thus seen as the result or discrete recursive combinatorics over lexical items which get assembled into phrases, which are themselves combined to form sentences. This view is common to European and American structuralism (e.g., Benveniste, 1971; Hockett, 1958) and different incarnations of generative grammar, transformational and non-transformational (Chomsky, 1956, 1995; and Kaplan & Bresnan, 1982; Gazdar, 1982). Since at least Uriagereka (2002), there has been some attention paid to the fact that syntactic operations must apply somewhere, particularly when copying and movement operations are considered. Contemporary syntactic theory has thus somewhat acknowledged the importance of formalizing aspects of the spaces in which elements are manipulated, but it is still a vastly underexplored area. In this paper we explore the consequences of conceptualizing syntax as a set of topological operations applying over spaces rather than over discrete elements. We argue that there are empirical advantages in such a view for the treatment of long-distance dependencies and cross-derivational dependencies: constraints on possible configurations emerge from the dynamics of the system."

We convert the LTL property into a limit deterministic Buchi automaton and construct an on-the-fly synchronised product MDP. The control policy is then synthesised by defining an adaptive reward function and by applying a modified neural fitted Q-iteration algorithm to the synchronised structure, assuming that no prior knowledge is available from the original MDP. The proposed method is evaluated in a numerical study to test the quality of the generated control policy and is compared with conventional methods for policy synthesis such as MDP abstraction (Voronoi quantizer) and approximate dynamic programming (fitted value iteration)."

The central algorithmic problem for Petri nets is reachability: whether from the given initial configuration there exists a sequence of valid execution steps that reaches the given final configuration. The complexity of the problem has remained unsettled since the 1960s, and it is one of the most prominent open questions in the theory of verification. Decidability was proved by Mayr in his seminal STOC 1981 work, and the currently best published upper bound is non-primitive recursive Ackermannian of Leroux and Schmitz from LICS 2019. We establish a non-elementary lower bound, i.e. that the reachability problem needs a tower of exponentials of time and space. Until this work, the best lower bound has been exponential space, due to Lipton in 1976. The new lower bound is a major breakthrough for several reasons. Firstly, it shows that the reachability problem is much harder than the coverability (i.e., state reachability) problem, which is also ubiquitous but has been known to be complete for exponential space since the late 1970s. Secondly, it implies that a plethora of problems from formal languages, logic, concurrent systems, process calculi and other areas, that are known to admit reductions from the Petri nets reachability problem, are also not elementary. Thirdly, it makes obsolete the currently best lower bounds for the reachability problems for two key extensions of Petri nets: with branching and with a pushdown stack."

The indistinguishability-relation model turns out to be strictly more expressive than the one based on observations.

Moreover, when viewed as a navigational device, they lead to an XPath-like formalism that has a path expression for every MSO definable binary pattern. The resulting pebble tree transducers can apply arbitrary MSO definable tests to (the observable part of) their configurations, they (still) have a decidable typechecking problem, and they can model the recursion mechanism of XSLT. The time complexity of the typechecking problem for conjunctive queries that use MSO definable patterns can often be reduced through the use of invisible pebbles."

Our framework represents equational reasoning about concrete string diagrams and context-free families of string diagrams using double-pushout rewriting on graphs and context-free graph grammars respectively.

The parameters are accessed essentially by allowing counting down from the parameter value to 0 and branching depending on whether 0 has been reached. The main technical result is that in games, a player can win for some values of the parameters at all, if she can win for some values below an exponential bound. For many winning conditions, this implies decidability of any statements about a player being able to win with arbitrary quantification over the parameter values.   While the result seems broadly applicable, a specific motivation comes from the study of chains of strategies in games. Chains of games were recently suggested as a means to define a rationality notion based on dominance that works well with quantitative games by Bassett, Jecker, P., Raskin and Van den Boogard. From the main result of this paper, we obtain generalizations of their decidability results with much simpler proofs.   As both a core technical notion in the proof of the main result, and as a notion of potential independent interest, we look at boolean functions defined via graph game forms. Graph game forms have properties akin to monotone circuits, albeit are more concise. We raise some open questions regarding how concise they are exactly, which have a flavour similar to circuit complexity. Answers to these questions could improve the bounds in the main theorem."

The symposium took place in Saarbr\""ucken, Germany, from the 26th to the 28th of September 2018. The GandALF symposium was established by a group of Italian computer scientists interested in mathematical logic, automata theory, game theory, and their applications to the specification, design, and verification of complex systems. Its aim is to provide a forum where people from different areas, and possibly with different backgrounds, can fruitfully interact. GandALF has a truly international spirit, as witnessed by the composition of the program and steering committee and by the country distribution of the submitted papers."

We consider a model of random languages, defined by weighted context-free grammars. As the distribution of grammar weights broadens, a transition is found from a random phase, in which sentences are indistinguishable from noise, to an organized phase in which nontrivial information is carried. This marks the emergence of deep structure in the language, and can be understood by a competition between energy and entropy."

The notion of electronic contracts has emerged mostly due to technological advances and the electronic trading among companies and customers. Thereby new challenges have arisen to guarantee reliability among the stakeholders in electronic negotiations. In this scenery, the automatic verification of electronic contracts appeared as the solution but as a new challenge at the same time. An important task on verifying contracts is concerned of detecting conflicts in multi-party contracts. The problem of checking contracts has been largely addressed in the literature, but we are not aware about any method and tool that deals with multi-party contracts and conflict detection using a contract language. This work presents an automatic checker, so-called RECALL, for finding conflicts on multi-party contracts modeled by an extension of a contract language. We developed an automatic checking tool and also applied it to a a well-known case study of selling products that is characterized by multi-party aspects of the contracts. We also performed some experiments in order to show the tool performance w.r.t. the size of contracts."

In particular, stream runtime verification (SRV) takes the program trace as input streams and incrementally derives output streams. SRV can check logical properties and compute temporal metrics and statistics from the trace. We present TeSSLa, a temporal stream-based specification language for SRV. TeSSLa supports timestamped events natively and is hence suitable for streams that are both sparse and fine-grained, which often occur in practice. We prove results on TeSSLa's expressiveness and compare different TeSSLa fragments to (timed) automata, thereby inheriting various decidability results. Finally, we present a monitor implementation and prove its correctness."
2018-08-30 11:49:31+00:00,2020-04-08 08:12:21+00:00,"As shown in (http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.22.998377), the usual update modes of Boolean networks (BNs), including synchronous and (generalized) asynchronous, fail to capture behaviors introduced by multivalued refinements. Thus, update modes do not allow a correct abstract reasoning on dynamics of biological systems, as they may lead to reject valid BN models.This technical report lists the main definitions and properties of the most permissive semantics of BNs introduced in http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.22.998377. This semantics meets with a correct abstraction of any multivalued refinements, with any update mode. It subsumes all the usual updating modes, while enabling new behaviors achievable by more concrete models. Moreover, it appears that classical dynamical analyzes of reachability and attractors have a simpler computational complexity:- reachability can be assessed in a polynomial number of iterations. The computation of iterations is in NP in the very general case, and is linear when local functions are monotonic, or with some usual representations of functions of BNs (binary decision diagrams, Petri nets, automata networks, etc.). Thus, reachability is in P with locally-monotonic BNs, and P$^{\text{NP}}$ otherwise (instead of being PSPACE-complete with update modes);- deciding wherever a configuration belongs to an attractor is in coNP with locally-monotonic BNs, and coNP$^{\text{coNP}}$ otherwise (instead of PSPACE-complete with update modes).Furthermore, we demonstrate that the semantics completely captures any behavior achievable with any multilevel or ODE refinement of the BN; and the semantics is minimal with respect to this model refinement criteria: to any most permissive trajectory, there exists a multilevel refinement of the BN which can reproduce it.In brief, the most permissive semantics of BNs enables a correct abstract reasoning on dynamics of BNs, with a greater tractability than previously introduced update modes."

The research mostly focuses on synthesis of systems dealing with Boolean signals. But real-life systems are often described using bit-vectors, integers, etc. Bit-blasting would make such systems unreadable, hit synthesis scalability, and is not possible for infinite data-domains. One step closer to real-life systems are register transducers: they can store data-input into registers and later output the content of a register, but they do not directly depend on the data-input, only on its comparison with the registers. Previously it was proven that synthesis of register transducers from register automata is undecidable, but there the authors considered transducers equipped with the unbounded queue of registers. First, we prove the problem becomes decidable if bound the number of registers in transducers, by reducing the problem to standard synthesis of Boolean systems. Second, we show how to use quantified temporal logic, instead of automata, for specifications."

However, many shortcomings of LTL have been identified in the literature, among them the limited expressiveness, the lack of quantitative features, and the inability to express robustness. There is work on overcoming these shortcomings, but each of these is typically addressed in isolation. This is insufficient for applications where all shortcomings manifest themselves simultaneously.   Here, we tackle this issue by introducing logics that address more than one shortcoming. To this end, we combine the logics Linear Dynamic Logic, Prompt-LTL, and robust LTL, each addressing one aspect, to new logics. For all combinations of two aspects, the resulting logic has the same desirable algorithmic properties as plain LTL. In particular, the highly efficient algorithmic backends that have been developed for LTL are also applicable to these new logics. Finally, we discuss how to address all three aspects simultaneously."

For prime alphabets, we show that this group is virtually cyclic, and that for composite alphabets it is non-amenable. For alphabet size four, it is a linear group. For non-prime non-four alphabets, it contains copies of all finitely-generated groups of RCA.

Different data structures yield different approaches to the parallel extrusion problem. We map three well-known causal semantics into our framework.

In particular, we refer to collaborations involving processes with arbitrary topology, thus overcoming the well-structuredness limitations. The proposed classification is based on some of the most important correctness properties in the business process domain, namely safeness and soundness. We prove, with a uniform formal framework, some conjectured and expected results and, most of all, we achieve novel results for BPMN collaborations concerning the relationships between safeness and soundness, and their compositionality, that represent major advances in the state-of-the-art."

To maximize this reuse in a general-purpose programming setting, programmers need a mechanism to identify dynamic allocations (of data and subcomputations) that correspond over time. We present Fungi, a typed functional language for incremental computation with names. Unlike prior general-purpose languages for incremental computing, Fungi's notion of names is formal, general, and statically verifiable. Fungi's type-and-effect system permits the programmer to encode (program-specific) local invariants about names, and to use these invariants to establish global uniqueness for their composed programs, the property of using names correctly. We prove that well-typed Fungi programs respect global uniqueness. We derive a bidirectional version of the type and effect system, and we have implemented a prototype of Fungi in Rust. We apply Fungi to a library of incremental collections, showing that it is expressive in practice."

Their tricky and misunderstood behaviors pose a hard challenge for static analysis of these programming languages. A key aspect of any dynamic language program is the multiple usage of strings, since they can be implicitly converted to another type value, transformed by string-to-code primitives or used to access an object-property. Unfortunately, string analyses for dynamic languages still lack precision and do not take into account some important string features. Moreover, string obfuscation is very popular in the context of dynamic language malicious code, for example, to hide code information inside strings and then to dynamically transform strings into executable code. In this scenario, more precise string analyses become a necessity. This paper is placed in the context of static string analysis by abstract interpretation and proposes a new semantics for string analysis, placing a first step for handling dynamic languages string features."

While such an approach cannot match ad-hoc proofs with regard to tightness of memory bounds, it has two advantages: first, it gives a widely-applicable criterion for FM determinacy; second, it helps to understand the cornerstones of FM determinacy, which are often hidden but common in proofs for specific (combinations of) winning conditions."

The second approach defines decentralized specifications wherein multiple specifications are provided for separate parts of the system. We study two properties of decentralized specifications pertaining to monitorability and compatibility between specification and architecture. We also present a general algorithm for monitoring decentralized specifications. We map three existing algorithms to our approaches and provide a framework for analyzing their behavior.

Our approach is based on exploring the possible program orders, which define the order in which instructions of a thread are executed, and read-from relations, which specify how reads obtain their values from writes. This is in contrast to previous approaches, which also explore the possible coherence orders, i.e., orderings between conflicting writes. Since unexpected test results such as program crashes or assertion violations depend only on the read-from relation, we avoid a potentially significant source of redundancy. Our framework is based on a novel technique for determining whether a particular read-from relation is feasible under the RA semantics. We define an SMC algorithm which is provably optimal in the sense that it explores each program order and read-from relation exactly once. This optimality result is strictly stronger than previous analogous optimality results, which also take coherence order into account. We have implemented our framework in the tool Tracer. Experiments show that Tracer can be significantly faster than state-of-the-art tools that can handle the RA semantics."

We show that deciding critical observability is (i) NL-complete for finite automata, that is, it is efficiently verifiable on parallel computers, (ii) PSPACE-complete for networks of finite automata, that is, it is very unlikely solvable in polynomial time, and (iii) undecidable for labeled Petri nets, but becoming decidable if the set of critical states (markings) is finite or co-finite, in which case the problem is as hard as the non-reachability problem for Petri nets."

Neurons are modelled as timed automata waiting for inputs on a number of different channels (synapses), for a given amount of time (the accumulation period). When this period is over, the current potential value is computed considering current and past inputs. If this potential overcomes a given threshold, the automaton emits a broadcast signal over its output channel , otherwise it restarts another accumulation period. After each emission, the automaton remains inactive for a fixed refractory period. Spiking neural networks are formalised as sets of automata, one for each neuron, running in parallel and sharing channels according to the network structure. Such a model is formally validated against some crucial properties defined via proper temporal logic formulae. The model is then exploited to find an assignment for the synaptical weights of neural networks such that they can reproduce a given behaviour. The core of this approach consists in identifying some correcting actions adjusting synaptical weights and back-propagating them until the expected behaviour is displayed. A concrete case study is discussed."

Thirdly, we study the sequence of indices at which this formal inverse takes value $1$, and we show that it is not $k$-regular for any $k\ge 2$ by connecting it to the characteristic sequence of Fibonacci numbers. We leave as an open problem the case of the sequence of indices at which this formal inverse takes value $0$. We end the paper with a remark on the case of generalized Thue-Morse sequences."

Our main technical result is a quasi-polynomial lower bound on the size of such separating automata that nearly matches the current best upper bounds. This forms a barrier that all existing approaches must overcome in the ongoing quest for a polynomial-time algorithm for solving parity games. The key and fundamental concept that we introduce and study is a universal ordered tree. The technical highlights are a quasi-polynomial lower bound on the size of universal ordered trees and a proof that every separating safety automaton has a universal tree hidden in its state space."

This solution, however, generates all Boolean combinations of the predicates, which easily causes an exponential blowup in the number of transitions. Therefore, we propose two more advanced solutions. The first one still applies mintermisation but in a local way, mitigating the size of the exponential blowup. The other one focuses on a novel symbolic way of dealing with transitions, for which we need to sacrifice the counting technique of the original algorithm (counting is used to decrease the dependency of the running time on the number of transitions from quadratic to linear). We perform a thorough experimental evaluation of all the algorithms, together with several further alternatives, showing that all of them have their merits in practice, but with the clear indication that in most of the cases, efficient treatment of symbolic transitions is more beneficial than counting."

The sequence $\nu_w$ exists and is unique for every word with well-defined positive uniform frequencies of every factor, or, in dynamical terms, for every element of a uniquely ergodic subshift. In this paper we describe the construction of $\nu_w$ for the case when the subshift of $w$ is generated by a morphism of a special kind; then we overcome some technical difficulties to extend the result to all binary morphisms. The sequence $\nu_w$ in this case is also constructed with a morphism.   At last, we introduce a software tool which, given a binary morphism $\varphi$, computes the morphism on extended intervals and first elements of the equidistributed sequences associated with fixed points of $\varphi$."

Our aim is to design an ATL (Alternating-Time Temporal Logic) model checker from a context-free grammar which generates the language of the ATL formulas. An attribute grammar may be informally defined as a context-free grammar which is extended with a set of attributes and a collection of semantic rules. We use an ATL attribute grammar for specifying an operational semantics of the language of the ATL formulas by defining a translation into the language which describes the set of states from the ATL model where the corresponding ATL formulas are satisfied. We provide a formal definition for an attribute grammar used as input for Another Tool for Language Recognition (ANTLR) to generate an ATL model checker. Also, the technique of implementing the semantic actions in ANTLR is presented, which is the concept of connection between attribute evaluation in the grammar that generates the language of ATL formulas and algebraic compiler implementation that represents the ATL model checker. The original implementation of the model checking algorithm is based on Relational Databases and Web Services. Several database systems and Web Services technologies were used for evaluating the system performance in verification of large ATL models."
2018-07-21 20:23:03+00:00,2020-04-06 09:02:38+00:00,"Runtime monitoring is commonly used to detect the violation of desired properties in safety critical cyber-physical systems by observing its executions. Bauer et al. introduced an influential framework for monitoring Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) properties based on a three-valued semantics: the formula is already satisfied by the given prefix, it is already violated, or it is still undetermined, i.e., it can still be satisfied and violated by appropriate extensions. However, a wide range of formulas are not monitorable under this approach, meaning that they have a prefix for which satisfaction and violation will always remain undetermined no matter how it is extended. In particular, Bauer et al. report that 44% of the formulas they consider in their experiments fall into this category.   Recently, a robust semantics for LTL was introduced to capture different degrees by which a property can be violated. In this paper we introduce a robust semantics for finite strings and show its potential in monitoring: every formula considered by Bauer et al. is monitorable under our approach. Furthermore, we discuss which properties that come naturally in LTL monitoring - such as the realizability of all truth values - can be transferred to the robust setting. Lastly, we show that LTL formulas with robust semantics can be monitored by deterministic automata and report on a prototype implementation."

These problems are known to be undecidable when the transductions are relations between words realized by non-deterministic transducers, and become decidable when restricting to functions from words to words. Here we prove that decidability can be equally recovered by adopting a slightly different, but natural semantics, called origin semantics and introduced by Bojanczyk in 2014. Specifically, we prove that the equivalence and containment problems for two-way word transducers in the origin semantics are PSPACE-complete. We also consider a variant of the containment problem where two-way transducers are compared under the origin semantics, but in a more relaxed way, by allowing distortions of the origins. The possible distortions are described by means of a resynchronization relation. We propose a logical formalism for describing a broad class of resynchronizations, while preserving the decidability of the variant of the containment problem."

The knapsack problem for a finitely generated group $G$ is the following decision problem: given a tuple $(g, g_1, \ldots, g_k)$ of elements of $G$, are there natural numbers $n_1, \ldots, n_k \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $g = g_1^{n_1} \cdots g_k^{n_k}$ holds in $G$? Myasnikov, Nikolaev, and Ushakov proved that for every (Gromov-)hyperbolic group, the knapsack problem can be solved in polynomial time. In this paper, the precise complexity of the knapsack problem for hyperbolic group is determined: for every hyperbolic group $G$, the knapsack problem belongs to the complexity class $\mathsf{LogCFL}$, and it is $\mathsf{LogCFL}$-complete if $G$ contains a free group of rank two. Moreover, it is shown that for every hyperbolic group $G$ and every tuple $(g, g_1, \ldots, g_k)$ of elements of $G$ the set of all $(n_1, \ldots, n_k) \in \mathbb{N}^k$ such that $g = g_1^{n_1} \cdots g_k^{n_k}$ in $G$ is semilinear and a semilinear representation where all integers are of size polynomial in the total geodesic length of the $g, g_1, \ldots, g_k$ can be computed. Groups with this property are also called knapsack-tame. This enables us to show that knapsack can be solved in $\mathsf{LogCFL}$ for every group that belongs to the closure of hyperbolic groups under free products and direct products with $\mathbb{Z}$."

We assume the actuator attacker partially observes the execution of the closed-loop system and eavesdrops the control commands issued by the supervisor. The attacker can modify each control command on a specified subset of attackable events. The attack principle of the actuator attacker is to remain covert until it can establish a successful attack and lead the attacked closed-loop system into generating certain damaging strings. We present a characterization for the existence of a successful attacker, via a new notion of attackability, and prove the existence of the supremal successful actuator attacker, when both the supervisor and the attacker are normal (that is, unobservable events to the supervisor cannot be disabled by the supervisor and unobservable events to the attacker cannot be attacked by the attacker). Finally, we present an algorithm to synthesize the supremal successful attackers that are represented by Moore automata."

Surprisingly enough, time-dependent evolution provides a significant change in the computational power of quantum automata with respect to a discrete quantum model. Indeed, we show that if a scheduler is not computationally restricted, then a CTQA can decide the Halting problem. In order to unearth the computational capabilities of CTQAs we study the case of a computationally restricted scheduler. In particular we showed that depending on the type of restriction imposed on the scheduler, a CTQA can (i) recognize non-regular languages with cut-point, even in the presence of Karp-Lipton advice, and (ii) recognize non-regular languages with bounded-error. Furthermore, we study the closure of concatenation and union of languages by introducing a new model of Moore-Crutchfield quantum finite automata with a rotating tape head. CTQA presents itself as a new model of computation that provides a different approach to a formal study of ""classical control, quantum data"" schemes in quantum computing."

It computes the maximal $n$-step payoff by iterating $n$ times a recurrence equation which is naturally associated to the MDP. At the same time, value iteration provides a policy for the MDP that is optimal on a given finite horizon $n$. In this paper, we settle the computational complexity of value iteration. We show that, given a horizon $n$ in binary and an MDP, computing an optimal policy is EXP-complete, thus resolving an open problem that goes back to the seminal 1987 paper on the complexity of MDPs by Papadimitriou and Tsitsiklis. As a stepping stone, we show that it is EXP-complete to compute the $n$-fold iteration (with $n$ in binary) of a function given by a straight-line program over the integers with $\max$ and $+$ as operators."

This paper considers the problem of intrusion detection and mitigation in supervisory control systems, where the attacker has the ability to enable or disable vulnerable actuator commands and erase or insert vulnerable sensor readings. We present a mathematical model for the system under certain classes of actuator enablement attacks, sensor erasure attacks, or sensor insertion attacks. We then propose a defense strategy that aims to detect such attacks online and disables all controllable events after an attack is detected. We develop an algorithmic procedure for verifying whether the system can prevent damage from the attacks considered with the proposed defense strategy, where damage is modeled as the reachability of a pre-defined set of unsafe system states.The technical condition of interest that is necessary and sufficient in this context, termed ""GF-safe controllability"", is characterized. We show that the verification of GF-safe controllability can be performed using diagnoser or verifier automata. Finally, we illustrate the methodology with a traffic control system example."

We consider the model of unambiguous Cost Register Automata (CRAs), which are machines that combine finite-state control (for identifying regular patterns) with a finite set of data registers (for computing numerical aggregates). The definition of CRAs is parameterized by the collection of numerical operations that can be applied to the registers. These machines give rise to the class of streamable regular transductions (SR), and to the class of streamable linear regular transductions (SLR) when the register updates are copyless, i.e. every register appears at most once the right-hand-side expressions of the updates. We give a logical characterization of the class SR (resp., SLR) using MSO-definable transformations from strings to DAGs (resp., trees) without backward edges. Additionally, we establish that the two classes SR and SLR are closed under operations that are relevant for designing query languages. Finally, we study the relationship with weighted automata (WA), and show that CRAs over a suitably chosen set of operations correspond to WA, thus establishing that WA are a special case of CRAs."

In CNA communication actions are given not in terms of channels but in terms of chains of links that record the source and the target ends of each hop of interactions. The operational semantics of our calculus mildly extends the one of CCS. The abstract semantics is given in the style of bisimulation but requires some ingenuity. Remarkably, the abstract semantics is a congruence for all operators of CNA and also with respect to substitutions, which is not the case for strong bisimilarity in CCS. As a motivating and running example, we illustrate the model of a simple software defined network infrastructure."

The framework is largely inspired by the control of a biological system, namely a population of yeasts, where the controller may only change the environment common to all cells. We study a synchronisation problem for such populations: no matter how individual agents react to the actions of the controller, the controller aims at driving all agents synchronously to a target state. The agents are naturally represented by a non-deterministic finite state automaton (NFA), the same for every agent, and the whole system is encoded as a 2-player game. The first player (Controller) chooses actions, and the second player (Agents) resolves non-determinism for each agent. The game with m agents is called the m -population game. This gives rise to a parameterized control problem (where control refers to 2 player games), namely the population control problem: can Controller control the m-population game for all m in N whatever Agents does?"

As PEGs do not provide a good error recovery mechanism, PEG-based parsers usually do not recover from syntax errors in the input, or recover from syntax errors using ad-hoc, implementation-specific features. The lack of proper error recovery makes PEG parsers unsuitable for using with Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), which need to build syntactic trees even for incomplete, syntactically invalid programs.   We propose a conservative extension, based on PEGs with labeled failures, that adds a syntax error recovery mechanism for PEGs. This extension associates recovery expressions to labels, where a label now not only reports a syntax error but also uses this recovery expression to reach a synchronization point in the input and resume parsing. We give an operational semantics of PEGs with this recovery mechanism, and use an implementation based on such semantics to build a robust parser for the Lua language. We evaluate the effectiveness of this parser, alone and in comparison with a Lua parser with automatic error recovery generated by ANTLR, a popular parser generator."

We model a DIMA system as a set of stopwatch automata in UPPAAL to verify its schedulability by model checking. However, direct model checking is infeasible due to the large state space. Therefore, we introduce the compositional analysis that checks each partition including its communication environment individually. Based on a notion of message interfaces, a number of message sender automata are built to model the environment for a partition. We define a timed selection simulation relation, which supports the construction of composite message interfaces. By using assume-guarantee reasoning, we ensure that each task meets the deadline and that communication constraints are also fulfilled globally.

This modelling formalism is mostly used for checking whether the behaviours of a system satisfy a set of properties of interest. Even if efficient model-checkers for Timed Automata exist, these tools are not easily configurable. First, they are not designed to easily allow adding new Timed Automata constructs, such as new synchronization mechanisms or communication procedures, but they assume a fixed set of Timed Automata constructs. Second, they usually do not support the full Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL) and rely on a precise semantics for the logic in which the property of interest is specified which cannot be easily modified and customized. Finally, they do not easily allow using different solvers that may speed up verification in different contexts. This paper presents a novel technique to perform model checking of full Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL) properties on TA. The technique relies on the translation of both the TA and the MITL formula into an intermediate Constraint LTL over clocks (CLTLoc) formula which is verified through an available decision procedure. The technique is flexible since the intermediate logic allows the encoding of new semantics as well as new TA constructs, by just adding new CLTLoc formulae. Furthermore, our technique is not bound to a specific solver as the intermediate CLTLoc formula can be verified using different procedures."

That is, more transformations in the inputs means higher state complexity in the output. When this correlation holds, the state complexity of a unary operation can be maximized using languages in which there is one letter corresponding to each possible transformation; for operations of higher arity, we can use $m$-tuples of languages in which there is one letter corresponding to each possible $m$-tuple of transformations. In this way, a small set of languages can be used as witnesses for many common regular operations, eliminating the need to search for witnesses -- though at the expense of using very large alphabets. We formalize this approach and examine its limitations. We define a class of ""uniform"" operations for which this approach works; the class is closed under composition and includes common operations such as star, concatenation, reversal, union, and complement. Our main result is that the worst-case state complexity of a uniform operation can be determined by considering a finite set of witnesses, and this set depends only on the arity of the operation and the state complexities of the inputs."

We say an integer sequence $\mathbf{u}=\{u(n)\}_{n\geq0}$ is a polynomial generated sequence if $$\{u(kn+i)\}_{n\geq0}=f_i(\mathbf{u}),~(0\leq i< k).$$ %Here we define $\mathbf{u}\mathbf{v}:=\{u(n)v(n)\}_{n\geq0}$ and $\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{v}:=\{u(n)+v(n)\}_{n\geq0}$ for any two sequences $\mathbf{u}=\{u(n)\}_{n\geq0}, \mathbf{v}=\{v(n)\}_{n\geq0}.$   In this paper, we study the polynomial generated sequences. Assume $k\geq2$ and $f_i(x)=\mathbf{a}_ix+\mathbf{b}_i~(0\leq i< k)$. If $\mathbf{a}_i$ are $k$-automatic and $\mathbf{b}_i$ are $k$-regular for $0\leq i< k$, then we prove that the corresponding polynomial generated sequences are $k$-regular. As a application, we prove that the Hankel determinant sequence $\{\det(p_{i+j})_{i,j=0}^{n-1}\}_{n\geq0}$ is $2$-regular, where $\{p(n)\}_{n\geq0}=0110100010000\cdots$ is the characteristic sequence of powers 2.

2018-06-18 15:14:03+00:00,2018-08-30 13:33:06+00:00,"In 2005, Abramsky introduced various linear/affine combinatory algebras of partial involutions over a suitable formal language, to discuss reversible computation in a game-theoretic setting. These algebras arise as instances of the general paradigm explored by Haghverdi (Abramsky's Programme), which amounts to defining a lambda-algebra starting from a GoI Situation in a traced symmetric monoidal category. We investigate this construction from the point of view of the model theory of lambda-calculus. We focus on the strictly linear and affine parts of Abramsky's Affine Combinatory Algebras, sketching how to encompass the full algebra. The gist of our approach is that the GoI interpretation of a term based on involutions is dual to the principal type of the term, w.r.t. the type discipline for a linear/affine lambda-calculus. In the general case the type discipline and the calculus need to be extended, resp., with intersection, !-types, and !-abstractions. Our analysis unveils three conceptually independent, but ultimately equivalent, accounts of application in the lambda-calculus: beta-reduction, the GoI application of involutions based on symmetric feedback (Girard's Execution Formula), and unification of principal types. Thus we provide an answer, in the strictly affine case, to the question raised in [1] of characterising the partial involutions arising from bi-orthogonal pattern matching automata, which are denotations of affine combinators, and we point to the answer to the full question. Furthermore, we prove that the strictly linear combinatory algebra of partial involutions is a strictly linear lambda-algebra, albeit not a combinatory model, while both the strictly affine combinatory algebra and the full affine combinatory algebra are not. To check all the equations involved in the definition of affine lambda-algebra, we implement in Erlang application of involutions."

Normal forms of such automata are given. Deque languages form an AFL but not a full one. We define the characteristic deque language, CDL, which combines Dyck and AntiDyck (or FIFO) languages, and homomorphically characterizes the deque languages. The notion of deque graph, from graph theory, well represents deque computation by means of a planar hamiltonian graph on a cylinder, with edges visualizing producer-consumer relations for deque symbols. We give equivalent definitions of CDL by labelled deque graphs, by cancellation rules, and by means of shuffle and intersection of simpler languages. The labeled deque graph of a sentence generalizes traditional syntax trees. The layout of deque computations on a cylinder is remindful of 3D models used in theoretical (bio)chemistry."

This is done in two different settings: when the code is defined by an arbitrary decoder recognizing its star and when the code is defined by its literal decoder (whose size is polynomially equivalent to the total length of all words in the code). For the first case for every $\varepsilon > 0$ we prove $n^{1 - \varepsilon}$-inapproximability for recognizable binary maximal prefix codes, $\Theta(\log n)$-inapproximability for finite binary maximal prefix codes and $n^{\frac{1}{2} - \varepsilon}$-inapproximability for finite binary prefix codes. By $c$-inapproximability here we mean the non-existence of a $c$-approximation polynomial time algorithm under the assumption P $\ne$ NP, and by $n$ the number of states of the decoder in the input. For the second case, we propose approximation and exact algorithms and conjecture that for finite maximal prefix codes the problem can be solved in polynomial time. We also study the related problems of finding a shortest mortal and a shortest avoiding word."

Monitors observe the outputs that are generated by a Markov chain during its run, with the goal of identifying runs as correct or faulty. A monitor is selective if it skips observations in order to reduce monitoring overhead. We are interested in monitors that minimize the expected number of observations. We establish an undecidability result for selectively monitoring general Markov chains. On the other hand, we show for non-hidden Markov chains (where any output identifies the state the Markov chain is in) that simple optimal monitors exist and can be computed efficiently, based on DFA language equivalence. These monitors do not depend on the precise transition probabilities in the Markov chain. We report on experiments where we compute these monitors for several open-source Java projects."

We introduce compressibility measures as a useful tool to classify the intersection problem for certain classes of finite semigroups into circuit complexity classes and Turing machine complexity classes. Using this framework, we obtain a new and simple proof that for groups and commutative semigroups, the problem is contained in NP. We uncover certain structural and non-structural properties determining the complexity of the intersection problem for varieties of semigroups containing only trivial submonoids. More specifically, we prove NP-hardness for classes of semigroups having a property called unbounded order and for the class of all nilpotent semigroups of bounded order. On the contrary, we show that bounded order and commutativity imply containment in the circuit complexity class qAC^k (for some k) and decidability in quasi-polynomial time. We also establish connections to the monoid variant of the problem."

One may ask whether $w$ occurs in $t$, and if so, where? More generally, we may have a set $P$ of patterns and a set $T$ of texts, where $P$ and $T$ are regular languages. We are interested whether any word of $T$ begins with a word of $P$, ends with a word of $P$, has a word of $P$ as a factor, or has a word of $P$ as a subsequence. Thus we are interested in the languages $(P\Sigma^*)\cap T$, $(\Sigma^*P)\cap T$, $(\Sigma^* P\Sigma^*)\cap T$, and $(\Sigma^* \mathbin{\operatorname{shu}} P)\cap T$, where $\operatorname{shu}$ is the shuffle operation. The state complexity $\kappa(L)$ of a regular language $L$ is the number of states in the minimal deterministic finite automaton recognizing $L$. We derive the following upper bounds on the state complexities of our pattern-matching languages, where $\kappa(P)\le m$, and $\kappa(T)\le n$: $\kappa((P\Sigma^*)\cap T) \le mn$; $\kappa((\Sigma^*P)\cap T) \le 2^{m-1}n$; $\kappa((\Sigma^*P\Sigma^*)\cap T) \le (2^{m-2}+1)n$; and $\kappa((\Sigma^*\mathbin{\operatorname{shu}} P)\cap T) \le (2^{m-2}+1)n$. We prove that these bounds are tight, and that to meet them, the alphabet must have at least two letters in the first three cases, and at least $m-1$ letters in the last case. We also consider the special case where $P$ is a single word $w$, and obtain the following tight upper bounds: $\kappa((w\Sigma^*)\cap T_n) \le m+n-1$; $\kappa((\Sigma^*w)\cap T_n) \le (m-1)n-(m-2)$; $\kappa((\Sigma^*w\Sigma^*)\cap T_n) \le (m-1)n$; and $\kappa((\Sigma^*\mathbin{\operatorname{shu}} w)\cap T_n) \le (m-1)n$.

We refer to this offspring of BNF as Math-BNF or MBNF, to the original BNF and its notational variants just as BNF, and to aspects common to both as BNF-style. What all BNF-style notations share is the use of production rules roughly of this form: $$\bullet \mathrel{::=} \circ_1 \mid \cdots \mid \circ_n $$ Normally, such a rule says ""every instance of $\circ_i$ for $i \in \{1, \ldots, n\}$ is also an in stance of $\bullet$"". MBNF is distinct from BNF in the entities and operations it allows. Instead of strings, MBNF builds arrangements of symbols that we call math-text. Sometimes ""syntax"" is defined by interleaving MBNF production rules and other mathematical definitions that can contain chunks of math-text. There is no clear definition of MBNF. Readers do not have a document which tells them how MBNF is to be read and must learn MBNF through a process of cultural initiation. To the extent that MBNF is defined, it is largely through examples scattered throughout the literature and which require readers to guess the mathematical structures underpinning them. This paper gives MBNF examples illustrating some of the differences between MBNF and BNF. We propose a definition of syntactic math text (SMT) which handles many (but far from all) uses of math-text and MBNF in the wild. We aim to balance the goal of being accessible and not requiring too much prerequisite knowledge with the conflicting goal of providing a rich mathematical structure that already supports many uses and has possibilities to be extended to support more challenging cases."

Here, $|m|$ is the usual absolute value of the integer $m$, $|m|_p$ its $p$-adic absolute value and $ |\langle x\rangle|$ denotes the distance from a real number $x$ to the set of integers. This still open conjecture stands as a variant of the well-known Littlewood Conjecture. In the same way as the latter, it admits a natural counterpart over the field of formal Laurent series $\mathbb{K}\left(\left(t^{-1}\right)\right)$ of a ground field $\mathbb{K}$. This is the so-called \emph{$t$-adic Littlewood Conjecture} ($t$-LC).   It is known that $t$--LC fails when the ground field $\mathbb{K}$ is infinite. This article is concerned with the much more difficult case when the latter field is finite. More precisely, a \emph{fully explicit} counterexample is provided to show that $t$-LC does not hold in the case that $\mathbb{K}$ is a finite field with characteristic 3. Generalizations to fields with characteristics different from 3 are also discussed.   The proof is computer assisted. It reduces to showing that an infinite matrix encoding Hankel determinants of the Paper-Folding sequence over $\mathbb{F}_3$, the so-called Number Wall of this sequence, can be obtained as a two-dimensional automatic tiling satisfying a finite number of suitable local constraints."

In this paper, we study the scope of the algebraic methods mentioned above, particularily as applied to the equivalence problem for register automata. We provide two results, one positive, one negative. The positive result is that equivalence is decidable for MSO transformations on unordered forests. The negative result comes from a try to extend this method to decide equivalence on macro tree transducers. We reduce macro tree transducers equivalence to an equivalence problem for some class of register automata naturally relevant to our method. We then prove this latter problem to be undecidable."

It is often realised by sequence alignment techniques, which are computationally expensive. This has led to increased research into alignment-free techniques, which are based on measures referring to the composition of sequences in terms of their constituent patterns. These measures, such as $q$-gram distance, are usually computed in time linear with respect to the length of the sequences. In this paper, we focus on the complementary idea: how two sequences can be efficiently compared based on information that does not occur in the sequences. A word is an {\em absent word} of some sequence if it does not occur in the sequence. An absent word is {\em minimal} if all its proper factors occur in the sequence. Here we present the first linear-time and linear-space algorithm to compare two sequences by considering {\em all} their minimal absent words. In the process, we present results of combinatorial interest, and also extend the proposed techniques to compare circular sequences. We also present an algorithm that, given a word $x$ of length $n$, computes the largest integer for which all factors of $x$ of that length occur in some minimal absent word of $x$ in time and space $\cO(n)$. Finally, we show that the known asymptotic upper bound on the number of minimal absent words of a word is tight."

State merging operations involving a large number of states are extracted, to provide sub-DFAs.

The tool we have developed unifies almost all of the work done in behavioral programming so far, under a common set of interfaces. Its architecture supports pluggable event selection strategies, which can make models more intuitive and compact. Program state space can be traversed using various algorithms, such as DFS and A*. Furthermore, program state is represented in a way that enables scanning a state space using parallel and distributed algorithms. Executable models created with this tool can be directly embedded in Java applications, enabling a model-first approach to system engineering, where initially a model is created and verified, and then a working application is gradually built around the model. The model itself consists of a collection of small scripts written in JavaScript (hence ""BPjs""). Using a variety of case-studies, this paper shows how the combination of a lenient programming language with formal model analysis tools creates an efficient way of developing robust complex systems. Additionally, as we learned from an experimental course we ran, the usage of JavaScript make practitioners more amenable to using this system and, thus, model checking and model driven engineering. In addition to providing infrastructure for development and case-studies in behavioral programming, the tool is designed to serve as a common platform for research and innovation in behavioral programming and in model driven engineering in general."

They are defined by the property that for any given length $k$, no factor of length $k$ has more $a$'s than the prefix of the same length. These words arise in the context of indexing for jumbled pattern matching (a.k.a. permutation matching or Parikh vector matching), where the aim is to decide whether a string has a factor with a given multiplicity of characters, i.e., with a given Parikh vector. Using prefix normal words, we give the first non-trivial characterization of binary words having the same set of Parikh vectors of factors. We prove that the language of prefix normal words is not context-free and is strictly contained in the language of pre-necklaces, which are prefixes of powers of Lyndon words.

For this metric we show that (1) optimal approximations always exist; (2) the problem has a bilinear program characterization; and (3) prove that its threshold problem is in PSPACE and NP-hard. In addition to the bilinear program solution, we present an approach inspired by expectation maximization techniques for computing suboptimal solutions to the problem. Experiments suggest that our method gives a practical approach that outperforms the bilinear program implementation run on state-of-the-art bilinear solvers."

Anti-powers are a natural converse to powers, and are objects of combinatorial interest in their own right. In this paper we initiate the algorithmic study of anti-powers. Given a string $S$, we describe an optimal algorithm for locating all substrings of $S$ that are anti-powers of a specified order. The optimality of the algorithm follows form a combinatorial lemma that provides a lower bound on the number of distinct anti-powers of a given order: we prove that a string of length $n$ can contain $\Theta(n^2/k)$ distinct anti-powers of order $k$."

It is interesting that the key tool for analysing directed lattice paths, which is the kernel method, is not directly applicable here. Therefore, we introduce a variant of this kernel method to get the trivariate generating function (length, final altitude, local time): this leads to an expression involving symmetric and algebraic functions. We apply this analysis to different types of constrained lattice paths (meanders , excursions, bridges,. . .). Then, we illustrate this approach on 'basketball walks ' which are walks defined by the jumps --2, --1, 0, +1, +2.

In this work, we establish a framework for learning probabilistic context-free grammars for protein sequences from syntactic trees partially constrained using amino acid contacts obtained from wet experiments or computational predictions, whose reliability has substantially increased recently. Within the framework, we implement the maximum-likelihood and contrastive estimators of parameters for simple yet practical grammars. Tested on samples of protein motifs, grammars developed within the framework showed improved precision in recognition and higher fidelity to protein structures.

Acting as synchronous distributed algorithms, they use their input graph as a network in which identical processors communicate for a possibly infinite number of synchronous rounds. For the local variant of those automata, where the number of rounds is bounded by a constant, Hella et al. (2012, 2015) have established a logical characterization in terms of basic modal logic. In this thesis, we provide similar logical characterizations for two more expressive classes of distributed automata.   The first class extends local automata with a global acceptance condition and the ability to alternate between nondeterministic and parallel computations. We show that it is equivalent to monadic second-order logic on graphs. By restricting transitions to be nondeterministic or deterministic, we also obtain two strictly weaker variants for which the emptiness problem is decidable.   Our second class transfers the standard notion of asynchronous algorithm to the setting of nonlocal distributed automata. The resulting machines are shown to be equivalent to a small fragment of least fixpoint logic, and more specifically, to a restricted variant of the modal {\mu}-calculus that allows least fixpoints but forbids greatest fixpoints. Exploiting the connection with logic, we additionally prove that the expressive power of those asynchronous automata is independent of whether or not messages can be lost."

Berstel found that the number of erasures can be linearly limited if the grammar is in Greibach normal form; Berstel and Boasson (and later, independently, Okhotin) proved a non-erasing variant of CST for grammars in Double Greibach Normal Form. In all these CST statements, however, the size of the Dyck alphabet $\Omega$ depends on the grammar size for $L$. In the Stanley variant of the CST, $|\Omega|$ only depends on $|\Sigma|$ and not on the grammar, but the homomorphism erases many more symbols than in the other versions of CST; also, the regular language $R$ is strictly locally testable but not local. We prove a new version of CST which combines both features of being non-erasing and of using a grammar-independent alphabet. In our construction, $|\Omega|$ is polynomial in $|\Sigma|$, namely $O(|\Sigma|^{46})$, and the regular language $R$ is strictly locally testable. Using a recent generalization of Medvedev's homomorphic characterization of regular languages, we prove that the degree in the polynomial dependence of $|\Omega|$ on $|\Sigma|$ may be reduced to just 2 in the case of linear grammars in Double Greibach Normal Form."

The ""DReAM"" (Dynamic Reconfigurable Architecture Modeling) framework, has been designed for modeling reconfigurable dynamic systems. It provides a rule-based language, inspired from Interaction Logic, which is expressive and easy to use encompassing all aspects of dynamicity including parametric multi-modal coordination with creation/deletion of components as well as mobility. Additionally, it allows the description of both endogenous/modular and exogenous/centralized coordination styles and sound transformations from one style to the other. The DReAM framework is implemented in the form of a Java API bundled with an execution engine.

In this paper, we concentrate on suffix-convex languages that do not belong to any one of these classes; we call such languages proper. In order to study this language class, we define a structure called a suffix-convex triple system that characterizes the automata recognizing suffix-convex languages. We find tight upper bounds for reversal, star, product, and boolean operations of proper suffix-convex languages, and we conjecture on the size of the largest syntactic semigroup.

It is known that the problem ""Given an automatic relation, does it have a uniformization by a subsequential transducer?"" is decidable in the two variants where the uniformization can either be implemented by an arbitrary subsequential transducer or it has to be implemented by a synchronous transducer.

Group automata are automata where all letters act as permutations on the set of states, and they are not synchronizing (unless they have one state). In almost-group automata, one of the letters acts as a permutation on $n-1$ states, and the others as permutations. We prove that this small change is enough for automata to become synchronizing with high probability. More precisely, we establish that the probability that a strongly connected almost-group automaton is not synchronizing is $\frac{2^{k-1}-1}{n^{2(k-1)}}(1+o(1))$, for a $k$-letter alphabet."

Current software systems of formal language objects do not have a mechanism to define such objects. We define transducers in which transition labels involve what we call set specifications, some of which are alphabet invariant. In fact, we give a more broad definition of automata-type objects, called labelled graphs, where each transition label can be any string, as long as that string represents a subset of a certain monoid. Then, the behaviour of the labelled graph is a subset of that monoid. We do the same for regular expressions. We obtain extensions of a few classic algorithmic constructions on ordinary regular expressions and transducers at the broad level of labelled graphs and in such a way that the computational efficiency of the extended constructions is not sacrificed. For regular expressions with set specs we obtain the corresponding partial derivative automata. For transducers with set specs we obtain further algorithms that can be applied to questions about independent regular languages, in particular the witness version of the independent property satisfaction question."

While it is known that there exist pseudovarieties with NP-complete or even undecidable membership problems, for many well-known pseudovarieties the problem is known to be decidable in polynomial time. We show that for many of these pseudovarieties, the membership problem is actually in AC^0. To this end, we show that these pseudovarieties can be characterized by first-order sentences with multiplication as the only predicate. We prove closure properties of the class of pseudovarieties with such first-order descriptions under various well-known operations; in particular, if V can be described by a first-order sentence, then DV, LV, and the Mal'cev products of K, D, N, LI, and LG with V are first-order definable as well. Moreover, if H is a first-order definable pseudovariety of finite groups, then the pseudovariety of all finite semigroups whose subgroups are in H is first-order definable. Our formalism is also powerful enough to capture all pseudovarieties characterized by finite sets of omega-identities. In view of lower bounds from circuit complexity, we obtain a new technique to prove that a pseudovariety V cannot be defined by such a set: if membership in V is hard for PARITY, it cannot be defined in this logic and thus cannot be described by finitely many omega-identities. We show that membership to EA is L-complete, thereby improving previous complexity results and obtaining a new proof that the pseudovariety cannot be described by finitely many omega-identities at the same time."

This extension requires a deep reworking of the models, game interpretation and test-synthesis algorithms.

There are many equivalent ways of defining them; Simon's congruence $\sim_k$ is one of the most classical approaches. Two words are $\sim_k$-equivalent if they have the same set of (scattered) subwords of length at most k. A language L is piecewise testable if there exists some k such that L is a union of $\sim_k$-classes. For each equivalence class of $\sim_k$, one can define a canonical representative in shortlex normal form, that is, the minimal word with respect to the lexicographic order among the shortest words in $\sim_k$. We present an algorithm for computing the canonical representative of the $\sim_k$-class of a given word $w \in A^*$ of length n. The running time of our algorithm is in O(|A|n) even if $k \le n$ is part of the input. This is surprising since the number of possible subwords grows exponentially in k. The case $k > n$ is not interesting since then, the equivalence class of w is a singleton. If the alphabet is fixed, the running time of our algorithm is linear in the size of the input word. Moreover, for fixed alphabet, we show that the computation of shortlex normal forms for $\sim_k$ is possible in deterministic logarithmic space. One of the consequences of our algorithm is that one can check with the same complexity whether two words are $\sim_k$-equivalent (with k being part of the input)."

RMA also extend register automata, by allowing arbitrary formulas, besides equality predicates. We study the closure properties of RMA under union, concatenation, Kleene+, complement and determinization and show that RMA, contrary to symbolic automata, are not determinizable when viewed as recognizers, without taking the output of transitions into account. However, when a window operator, a quintessential feature in Complex Event Processing, is used, RMA are indeed determinizable even when viewed as recognizers. We present detailed algorithms for constructing deterministic RMA from regular expressions extended with $n$-ary constraints. We show how RMA can be used in Complex Event Processing in order to detect patterns upon streams of events, using a framework that provides denotational and compositional semantics, and that allows for a systematic treatment of such automata."

We complement this positive result by showing that the emptiness problem remains undecidable even when restricted to automata of linear ambiguity. We then turn to finitely ambiguous automata. Here we show decidability of containment in case one of the automata is assumed to be unambiguous while the other one is allowed to be finitely ambiguous. Our proof of this last result relies on the decidability of the theory of real exponentiation, which has been shown, subject to Schanuel's Conjecture, by Macintyre and Wilkie."

Usually, finding an algorithm deciding $\mathscr{C}$-separation yields a deep insight on $\mathscr{C}$.   We consider classes defined by fragments of first-order logic. Given such a fragment, one may often build a larger class by adding more predicates to its signature. In the paper, we investigate the operation of enriching signatures with modular predicates. Our main theorem is a generic transfer result for this construction. Informally, we show that when a logical fragment is equipped with a signature containing the successor predicate, separation for the stronger logic enriched with modular predicates reduces to separation for the original logic.

Compared to Boolean Networks (BN), ABAN has a finer description of state transitions (from a local state to another, instead of symmetric Boolean functions).

Based on dimensionless signals moving on the real line, they model particle/signal dynamics in Cellular Automata. Each particle, or signal, moves at constant speed in continuous time and space. When signals meet, they get replaced by other signals. A signal machine defines the types of available signals, their speeds and the rules for replacement in collision. A signal machine A simulates another one B if all the space-time diagrams of B can be generated from space-time diagrams of A by removing some signals and renaming other signals according to local information. Given any finite set of speeds S, we construct a signal machine that is able to simulate any signal machine whose speeds belong to S. Each signal is simulated by a macro-signal, a ray of parallel signals. Each macro-signal has a main signal located exactly where the simulated signal would be, as well as auxiliary signals which encode its id and the collision rules of the simulated machine. The simulation of a collision, a macro-collision, consists of two phases. In the first phase, macro-signals are shrunk, then the macro-signals involved in the collision are identified and it is ensured that no other macro-signal comes too close. If some do, the process is aborted and the macro-signals are shrunk, so that the correct macro-collision will eventually be restarted and successfully initiated. Otherwise, the second phase starts: the appropriate collision rule is found and new macro-signals are generated accordingly. Considering all finite set of speeds S and their corresponding simulators provides an intrinsically universal family of signal machines."

We study how to do reactive synthesis when part of the specification of the system is that its behavior should be random. Randomness can be useful, for example, in a network protocol fuzz tester whose output should be varied, or a planner for a surveillance robot whose route should be unpredictable. However, existing reactive synthesis techniques do not provide a way to ensure random behavior while maintaining functional correctness. Towards this end, we generalize the recently-proposed framework of control improvisation (CI) to add reactivity. The resulting framework of reactive control improvisation provides a natural way to integrate a randomness requirement with the usual functional specifications of reactive synthesis over a finite window. We theoretically characterize when such problems are realizable, and give a general method for solving them. For specifications given by reachability or safety games or by deterministic finite automata, our method yields a polynomial-time synthesis algorithm. For various other types of specifications including temporal logic formulas, we obtain a polynomial-space algorithm and prove matching PSPACE-hardness results. We show that all of these randomized variants of reactive synthesis are no harder in a complexity-theoretic sense than their non-randomized counterparts."

This paper is a continuation of the abelian networks series of Bond and Levine (2016), for which we extend the theory of abelian networks that halt on all inputs to networks that can run forever. A nonhalting abelian network can be realized as a discrete dynamical system in many different ways, depending on the update order. We show that certain features of the dynamics, such as minimal period length, have intrinsic definitions that do not require specifying an update order.   We give an intrinsic definition of the \emph{torsion group} of a finite irreducible (halting or nonhalting) abelian network, and show that it coincides with the critical group of Bond and Levine (2016) if the network is halting. We show that the torsion group acts freely on the set of invertible recurrent components of the trajectory digraph, and identify when this action is transitive.   This perspective leads to new results even in the classical case of sinkless rotor networks (deterministic analogues of random walks). In Holroyd et. al (2008) it was shown that the recurrent configurations of a sinkless rotor network with just one chip are precisely the unicycles (spanning subgraphs with a unique oriented cycle, with the chip on the cycle). We generalize this result to abelian mobile agent networks with any number of chips. We give formulas for generating series such as \[ \sum_{n \geq 1} r_n z^n = \det (\frac{1}{1-z}D - A ) \] where $r_n$ is the number of recurrent chip-and-rotor configurations with $n$ chips; $D$ is the diagonal matrix of outdegrees, and $A$ is the adjacency matrix. A consequence is that the sequence $(r_n)_{n \geq 1}$ completely determines the spectrum of the simple random walk on the network."

For example, we may need to draw a verdict on whether the system satisfies or violates the property ""p holds infinitely often."" The problem is that there is always a continuation of a finite trace that satisfies the property and a different continuation that violates it.   We propose a two-step approach to address this problem. First, we introduce a counting semantics that computes the number of steps to witness the satisfaction or violation of a formula for each position in the trace. Second, we use this information to make a prediction on inconclusive suffixes. In particular, we consider a good suffix to be one that is shorter than the longest witness for a satisfaction, and a bad suffix to be shorter than or equal to the longest witness for a violation. Based on this assumption, we provide a verdict assessing whether a continuation of the execution on the same system will presumably satisfy or violate the property."

We quantify precisely how much digit dependence can be allowed such that, still, almost all real numbers are normal. Our theorem states that almost all real numbers are normal when at least slightly more than $\log \log n$ consecutive digits with indices starting at position $n$ are independent. As the main application, we consider the Toeplitz set $T_P$, which is the set of all sequences $a_1a_2 \ldots $ of symbols from $\{0, \ldots, b-1\}$ such that $a_n$ is equal to $a_{pn}$, for every $p$ in $P$ and $n=1,2,\ldots$. Here $b$ is an integer base and $P$ is a finite set of prime numbers. We show that almost every real number whose base $b$ expansion is in $T_P$ is normal to base $b$. In the case when $P$ is the singleton set $\{2\}$ we prove that more is true: almost every real number whose base $b$ expansion is in $T_P$ is normal to all integer bases. We also consider the Toeplitz transform which maps the set of all sequences to the set $T_P$ and we characterize the normal sequences whose Toeplitz transform is normal as well."

Nevertheless, such control methods cannot be directly applied for many practical engineering systems nowadays since they are open systems and their operation heavily depends on nontrivial interactions between the systems and the external environments. These open systems should be controlled in such a way that accomplishment of the control objective can be guaranteed for any possible environment, which may be dynamic, uncertain and sometimes unpredictable. In this paper, we aim at extending the conventional supervisory control theory to open discrete event systems in a reactive manner. Starting from a novel input-output automaton model of an open system, we consider control objectives that characterize the desired input-output behaviors of the system, based on which a game-theoretic approach is carried out to compute a reactive supervisor that steers the system to fulfill the specifications regardless of the environment behaviors. We present a necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such a reactive supervisor. Furthermore, illustrative examples are given throughout this paper to demonstrate the key definitions and the effectiveness of the proposed reactive supervisor synthesis framework."

That is, an arbitrary language is decomposable with respect to the source distribution if and only if it is decomposable with respect to each smaller sized distribution (in the reduction). The notion of reduction of distributions has previously been proposed to improve the complexity of decomposability verification. In this work, we address the problem of generating (optimal) reductions of distributions automatically. A (partial) solution to this problem is provided, which consists of 1) an incremental algorithm for the production of candidate reductions and 2) a reduction validation procedure. In the incremental production stage, backtracking is applied whenever a candidate reduction that cannot be validated is produced. A strengthened substitution-based proof technique is used for reduction validation, while a fixed template of candidate counter examples is used for reduction refutation; put together, they constitute our (partial) solution to the reduction verification problem. In addition, we show that a recursive approach for the generation of (small) reductions is easily supported."

A nondeterministic pushdown program checks whether the intersection of a regular language (the protocol to verify) and a given Dyck language containing all canceling words is empty. If it is not, an intruder can reveal secret messages sent between trusted users. The verification is guaranteed to terminate in cubic time at most on a 2NPDA-simulator. The interpretive approach used in this experiment simplifies the verification, by separating the nondeterministic pushdown logic and program control, and makes it more predictable. We describe the interpretive approach and the known transformational solutions, and show they share interesting features. Also noteworthy is how abstract results from automata theory can solve practical problems by programming language means."

In CBTC platforms, a prominent role is played by the Automatic Train Supervision (ATS) system, which automatically dispatches and routes trains within the metro network. Among the various functions, an ATS needs to avoid deadlock situations, i.e., cases in which a group of trains block each other. In the context of a technology transfer study, we designed an algorithm for deadlock avoidance in train scheduling. In this paper, we present a case study in which the algorithm has been applied. The case study has been encoded using ten different formal verification environments, namely UMC, SPIN, NuSMV/nuXmv, mCRL2, CPN Tools, FDR4, CADP, TLA+, UPPAAL and ProB. Based on our experience, we observe commonalities and differences among the modelling languages considered, and we highlight the impact of the specific characteristics of each language on the presented models."

We prove that the Order Problem is decidable when the state-activity is bounded. The Order Problem remains open for the next level of this hierarchy, that is, when the state-activity is linear.

The main finding is that reachability within a bounded number of context switches is in NP, independent of the memory (the graph monoid). Our proof is genuinely algebraic, and therefore contributes a new way to think about BCS. In addition, we exhibit a class of storage mechanisms for which BCS reachability belongs to P."

This information is represented in the form of a labeled transition system, which we call skeleton. Each state of the skeleton is labeled with a three-valued assignment to the output variables: each output can be true, false, or open, where true or false means that the value must be true or false, respectively, and open means that either value is still possible. We present algorithms for the verification of skeletons and for the learning-based synthesis of skeletons from specifications in linear-time temporal logic (LTL). The algorithm returns a skeleton that satisfies the given LTL specification in time polynomial in the size of the minimal skeleton. Our new analysis technique can be used to recognize and repair specifications that underspecify critical situations. The technique thus complements existing methods for the recognition and repair of overspecifications via the identification of unrealizable cores."

However, such artifacts may be too complex for humans to understand, because existing representations of counterexamples typically include a large number of paths or a complex automaton. To help improve the interpretability of counterexamples, we define a notion of explainable counterexample, which includes a set of structured natural language sentences to describe the robotic behavior that lead to a requirement violation in an MDP model of robotic mission plan. We propose an approach based on mixed-integer linear programming for generating explainable counterexamples that are minimal, sound and complete. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach via a case study of warehouse robots planning."

We study the distribution of linear-time models by investigating the density of linear-time properties over the space of ultimately periodic words. The density of a property over a bound n is the ratio of the number of lasso-shaped words of length n that satisfy the property to the total number of lasso-shaped words of length n. We investigate the problem of computing the density for both linear-time properties in general and for the important special case of omega-regular properties. For general linear-time properties, the density is not necessarily convergent and can oscillate indefinitely for certain properties. However, we show the oscillation can be bounded by the growth of the sets of bad- and good-prefix of the property. For omega-regular properties, we show that the density is always convergent and provide a general algorithm for computing the density of omega-regular properties as well as more specialized algorithms for certain sub-classes and their combinations."

MARS emphasises modelling over verification. It aims at discussing the lessons learned from making formal methods for the verification and analysis of realistic systems. Examples are:   (1) Which formalism is chosen, and why?   (2) Which abstractions have to be made and why?   (3) How are important characteristics of the system modelled?   (4) Were there any complications while modelling the system?   (5) Which measures were taken to guarantee the accuracy of the model?   We invited papers that present full models of real systems, which may lay the basis for future comparison and analysis. An aim of the workshop is to present different modelling approaches and discuss pros and cons for each of them. Alternative formal descriptions of the systems presented at this workshop are encouraged, which should foster the development of improved specification formalisms.   VPT aims to provide a forum where people from the areas of program transformation and program verification can fruitfully exchange ideas and gain a deeper understanding of the interactions between those two fields. These interactions have been beneficial in both directions. On the one hand, methods and tools developed in the field of program transformation, such as partial deduction, partial evaluation, fold/unfold transformations, and supercompilation, are applied with success to verification, in particular to the verification of infinite state and parameterized systems. On the other hand, methods developed in program verification, such as model checking, abstract interpretation, SAT and SMT solving, and automated theorem proving, are used to enhance program transformation techniques, thereby making these techniques more powerful and useful in practice."

In this paper, we investigate vN-regularity of various kinds of CA. First, we establish that, over any nontrivial configuration space, there always exist CA that are not vN-regular. Then, we obtain a partial classification of elementary vN-regular CA over $\{ 0,1\}^{\mathbb{Z}}$; in particular, we show that rules like 128 and 254 are vN-regular (and actually generalised inverses of each other), while others, like the well-known rules $90$ and $110$, are not vN-regular. Next, when $A$ and $G$ are both finite, we obtain a full characterisation of vN-regular CA over $A^G$. Finally, we study vN-regular linear CA when $A= V$ is a vector space over a field $\mathbb{F}$; we show that every vN-regular linear CA is invertible when $V= \mathbb{F}$ and $G$ is torsion-free elementary amenable (e.g. when $G=\mathbb{Z}^d, \ d \in \mathbb{N}$), and that every linear CA is vN-regular when $V$ is finite-dimensional and $G$ is locally finite with $Char(\mathbb{F}) \nmid o(g)$ for all $g \in G$."

These three equivalent definitions of the repetition threshold give rise to three natural definitions of a repetition threshold for circular words. The infimum of the set of all $\beta$ such that   - there are arbitrarily long $k$-ary $\beta$-free circular words is called the weak circular repetition threshold, denoted $\mathrm{CRT}_{\mathrm{W}}(k)$;   - there are $k$-ary $\beta$-free circular words of every sufficiently large length is called the intermediate circular repetition threshold, denoted $\mathrm{CRT}_{\mathrm{I}}(k)$;   - there are $k$-ary $\beta$-free circular words of every length is called the strong circular repetition threshold, denoted $\mathrm{CRT}_{\mathrm{S}}(k)$.

An automaton is called unambiguous if it has at most one accepting run on every input, the language of such an automaton is called an unambiguous language. It is known that not every regular language of infinite trees is unambiguous. Except that, very little is known about which regular tree languages are unambiguous.   This paper answers the question whether unambiguous languages are of bounded complexity among all regular tree languages. The notion of complexity is the canonical one, called the (parity or Rabin-Mostowski) index hierarchy. The answer is negative, as exhibited by a family of examples of unambiguous languages that cannot be recognised by any alternating parity tree automata of bounded range of priorities.   Hardness of the given examples is based on the theory of signatures in parity games, previously studied by Walukiewicz. This theory is further developed here to construct canonical signatures. The technical core of the article is a parity game that compares signatures of a given pair of parity games (without an increase in the index)."

These formalisms, also called regular document spanners, use regular languages in order to locate the data that a user wants to extract from a text document, and then store this data into variables. Since document spanners can easily generate large outputs, it is important to have good evaluation algorithms that can generate the extracted data in a quick succession, and with relatively little precomputation time. Towards this goal, we present a practical evaluation algorithm that allows constant delay enumeration of a spanner's output after a precomputation phase that is linear in the document. While the algorithm assumes that the spanner is specified in a syntactic variant of variable set automata, we also study how it can be applied when the spanner is specified by general variable set automata, regex formulas, or spanner algebras. Finally, we study the related problem of counting the number of outputs of a document spanner, providing a fine grained analysis of the classes of document spanners that support efficient enumeration of their results."

Infinite sequences of symbols are of paramount importance in a wide range of fields, from formal languages to pure mathematics and physics. While finite automata for recognising and transforming languages are well-understood, very little is known about the power of automata to transform infinite words.   The word transformation realised by finite-state transducers gives rise to a complexity comparison of words and thereby induces equivalence classes, called (transducer) degrees, and a partial order on these degrees. The ensuing hierarchy of degrees is analogous to the recursion-theoretic degrees of unsolvability, also known as Turing degrees, where the transformational devices are Turing machines. However, as a complexity measure, Turing machines are too strong: they trivialise the classification problem by identifying all computable words. Finite-state transducers give rise to a much more fine-grained, discriminating hierarchy. In contrast to Turing degrees, hardly anything is known about transducer degrees, in spite of their naturality.   We use methods from linear algebra and analysis to show that there are infinitely many atoms in the transducer degrees, that is, minimal non-trivial degrees."

We construct a dagger symmetric monoidal category of Borel kernels where the dagger-structure is given by Bayesian inversion. We show functorial bridges between this category and categories of Banach lattices which formalize the move from kernel-based semantics to predicate transformer (backward) or state transformer (forward) semantics. These bridges are related by natural transformations, and we show in particular that the Radon-Nikodym and Riesz representation theorems - two pillars of probability theory - define natural transformations.   With the mathematical infrastructure in place, we present a generic and endogenous approach to approximating kernels on standard Borel spaces which exploits the involutive structure of our category of kernels. The approximation can be formulated in several equivalent ways by using the functorial bridges and natural transformations described above. Finally, we show that for sensible discretization schemes, every Borel kernel can be approximated by kernels on finite spaces, and that these approximations converge for a natural choice of topology.   We illustrate the theory by showing two examples of how approximation can effectively be used in practice: Bayesian inference and the Kleene star operation of ProbNetKAT."

A tower controller would be making many decisions in real-time to sequence aircraft. While some optimization tools exist to help the controller in some airports, even in these situations, the real sequence of the aircraft adopted by the controller is significantly different from the one proposed by the optimization algorithm. This is due to the very dynamic nature of the environment. The objective of this paper is to test the hypothesis that one can learn from the sequence adopted by the controller some strategies that can act as heuristics in decision support tools for aircraft sequencing. This aim is tested in this paper by attempting to learn sequences generated from a well-known sequencing method that is being used in the real world. The approach relies on a genetic algorithm (GA) to learn these sequences using a society Probabilistic Finite-state Machines (PFSMs). Each PFSM learns a different sub-space; thus, decomposing the learning problem into a group of agents that need to work together to learn the overall problem. Three sequence metrics (Levenshtein, Hamming and Position distances) are compared as the fitness functions in GA. As the results suggest, it is possible to learn the behavior of the algorithm/heuristic that generated the original sequence from very limited information."

The size of both the deterministic left and right automaton of the bimachine is restricted by $2^{\vert Q\vert}$ where $\vert Q\vert$ is the number of transducer states. Other bimachine constructions lead to larger subautomata. As a concrete example we present a class of real-time functional transducers with $n+2$ states for which the standard bimachine construction generates a bimachine with at least $\Theta(n!)$ states whereas the construction based on the equalizer accumulation principle leads to $2^n + n +3$ states. Our construction can be applied to rational functions from free monoids to ""mge monoids"", a large class of monoids including free monoids, groups, and others that is closed under Cartesian products."

Smart contracts are envisioned to have a variety of applications, ranging from financial to IoT asset tracking. Unfortunately, the development of smart contracts has proven to be extremely error prone. In practice, contracts are riddled with security vulnerabilities comprising a critical issue since bugs are by design non-fixable and contracts may handle financial assets of significant value. To facilitate the development of secure smart contracts, we have created the FSolidM framework, which allows developers to define contracts as finite state machines (FSMs) with rigorous and clear semantics. FSolidM provides an easy-to-use graphical editor for specifying FSMs, a code generator for creating Ethereum smart contracts, and a set of plugins that developers may add to their FSMs to enhance security and functionality."

In this paper, we prove Becker's conjecture in the best-possible form; we show that the rational function $R(z)$ can be taken to be a polynomial $z^\gamma Q(z)$ for some explicit non-negative integer $\gamma$ and such that $1/Q(z)$ is $k$-regular."

This problem is at the heart of many distributed algorithms, and it is tightly related to questions from formal methods concerning the expressive power of distributed automata. We provide a non-deterministic gossip protocol for message-passing systems with unbounded FIFO channels, using only finitely many local states and a finite message alphabet. We show that this is optimal in the sense that there is no deterministic counterpart. As an application, the gossip protocol allows us to show that message-passing systems capture well-known extensions of linear-time temporal logics to a concurrent setting."

The parameterized verification of such models aims at checking whether a given property holds irrespective of the initial configuration (number of agents, initial states and initial communication topology). We focus here on the synchronization property, asking whether all agents converge to a set of target states after some execution. This problem is known to be decidable in polynomial time when no constraints are imposed on the evolution of the communication topology (while it is undecidable for static broadcast networks).   In this paper we investigate how various constraints on reconfigurations affect the decidability and complexity of the synchronization problem. In particular, we show that when bounding the number of reconfigured links between two communications steps by a constant, synchronization becomes undecidable; on the other hand, synchronization remains decidable in PTIME when the bound grows with the number of agents."

If the algorithm is randomized, then at each time instant it produces an incorrect output with probability at most $\epsilon$, which is a constant error bound. This work proposes a more relaxed definition of correctness which is parameterized by the error bound $\epsilon$ and the failure ratio $\phi$: A randomized sliding window algorithm is required to err with probability at most $\epsilon$ at a portion of $1-\phi$ of all time instants of an input stream. This work continues the investigation of sliding window algorithms for regular languages. In previous works a trichotomy theorem was shown for deterministic algorithms: the optimal space complexity is either constant, logarithmic or linear in the window size. The main results of this paper concerns three natural settings (randomized algorithms with failure ratio zero and randomized/deterministic algorithms with bounded failure ratio) and provide natural language theoretic characterizations of the space complexity classes."

Each such WQO induces a class of piecewise testable languages (PTLs) as Boolean combinations of upward closed sets. In this way, a range of regular language classes arises as PTLs. Moreover, each of the WQOs guarantees regularity of all downward closed sets. We consider two problems. First, we study which (perhaps non-regular) language classes permit a decision procedure to decide whether two given languages are separable by a PTL with respect to a given WQO. Second, we want to effectively compute downward closures with respect to these WQOs. Our first main result that for each of the WQOs, under mild assumptions, both problems reduce to the simultaneous unboundedness problem (SUP) and are thus solvable for many powerful system classes. In the second main result, we apply the framework to show decidability of separability of regular languages by $\mathcal{B}\Sigma_1[<, \mathsf{mod}]$, a fragment of first-order logic with modular predicates."

In the present work, we developed and evaluated a new approach that learns the building blocks of graphs that can be used to understand and generate new realistic graphs. Our key insight is that a graph's clique tree encodes robust and precise information. We show that a Hyperedge Replacement Grammar (HRG) can be extracted from the clique tree, and we develop a fixed-size graph generation algorithm that can be used to produce new graphs of a specified size. In experiments on large real-world graphs, we show that graphs generated from the HRG approach exhibit a diverse range of properties that are similar to those found in the original networks. In addition to graph properties like degree or eigenvector centrality, what a graph ""looks like"" ultimately depends on small details in local graph substructures that are difficult to define at a global level. We show that the HRG model can also preserve these local substructures when generating new graphs."

An automatic martingale bets if the incoming word belongs to the target language or not. Then randomness of both single languages and collections of languages is defined as a failure of automatic martingale to gain an unbounded capital by betting on the target language according to an incoming sequence of words, or a text. The randomness of formal languages turned out to be heavily dependent on the text. For very general classes of texts, any nonregular language happens to be random when considered individually. As for collections of languages, very general classes of texts permits nonrandomness of automatic families of languages only. On the other hand, an arbitrary computable language is be shown to be nonrandom under certain dynamic texts."

Since reachability analysis for hybrid nonlinear automata is a very challenging and computationally expensive problem, in practice, engineers try to solve the requirements falsification problem. In one method, the falsification problem is solved by minimizing a robustness metric induced by the requirements. This optimization problem is usually a non-convex non-smooth problem that requires heuristic and analytical guidance to be solved.

The local descent method is combined with Simulated Annealing as a global optimization method to search for unsafe behaviors."

One of them leads to the same class of languages as the ordinary Hammersley tree process. The other one yields non-context-free languages. The results are motivated by the problem of studying the analog of the famous Ulam-Hammersley problem for heapable sequences. Towards this goal we also give an algorithm for computing formal power series associated to the variants of Hammersley's process. We employ these algorithms to settle the nature of the scaling constant, conjectured in previous work to be the golden ratio. Our results provide experimental support to this conjecture."

In this paper, we investigate the verification of two detectability properties -- strong detectability and weak detectability -- for DESs modeled by labeled Petri nets. Strong detectability requires that we can always determine, after a finite number of observations, the current and subsequent markings of the system, while weak detectability requires that we can determine, after a finite number of observations, the current and subsequent markings for some trajectories of the system. We show that for DESs modeled by labeled Petri nets, checking strong detectability is decidable whereas checking weak detectability is undecidable. Our results extend the existing studies on the verification of detectability from finite-state automata to labeled Petri nets. As a consequence, we strengthen a result on checking current-state opacity for labeled Petri nets."

In this paper, we show that every regular function, either on finite words or on infinite words, captured by a deterministic two-way transducer, can be described with a regular transducer expression (RTE). For infinite words, the transducer uses Muller acceptance and $\omega$-regular look-ahead. \RTEs are constructed from constant functions using the combinators if-then-else (deterministic choice), Hadamard product, and unambiguous versions of the Cauchy product, the 2-chained Kleene-iteration and the 2-chained omega-iteration. Our proof works for transformations of both finite and infinite words, extending the result on finite words of Alur et al.\ in LICS'14. In order to construct an RTE associated with a deterministic two-way Muller transducer with look-ahead, we introduce the notion of transition monoid for such two-way transducers where the look-ahead is captured by some backward deterministic B\""uchi automaton. Then, we use an unambiguous version of Imre Simon's famous forest factorization theorem in order to derive a ""good"" ($\omega$-)regular expression for the domain of the two-way transducer. ""Good"" expressions are unambiguous and Kleene-plus as well as $\omega$-iterations are only used on subexpressions corresponding to \emph{idempotent} elements of the transition monoid. The combinator expressions are finally constructed by structural induction on the ""good"" ($\omega$-)regular expression describing the domain of the transducer."

This includes the definition of a suitable automaton model, and a generalization of the Glushkov construction. We demonstrate that, compared to their non-deterministic superclass, these deterministic regular expressions with back-references have desirable algorithmic properties (i.e., efficiently solvable membership problem and some decidable problems in static analysis), while, at the same time, their expressive power exceeds that of deterministic regular expressions without back-references."

The problem of deciding whether a given word equation has a solution was shown to be decidable by Makanin in the late 1970s, and since then considerable work has been done on this topic. In recent years, this decidability question has gained critical importance in the context of string SMT solvers for security analysis. Further, many extensions (e.g., quantifier-free word equations with linear arithmetic over the length function) and fragments (e.g., restrictions on the number of variables) of this theory are important from a theoretical point of view, as well as for program analysis applications. Motivated by these considerations, we prove several new results and thus shed light on the boundary between decidability and undecidability for many fragments and extensions of the first order theory of word equations."

Particularly, naturally arising questions about this learning setting, originating in results on learning from solely positive information, are answered. By a carefully arranged argument learners can be assumed to only change their hypothesis in case it is inconsistent with the data (such a learning behavior is called \emph{conservative}). The deduced main theorem states the relations between the most important delayable learning success criteria, being the ones not ruined by a delayed in time hypothesis output. Additionally, our investigations concerning the non-delayable requirement of consistent learning underpin the claim for \emph{delayability} being the right structural property to gain a deeper understanding concerning the nature of learning success criteria. Moreover, we obtain an anomalous \emph{hierarchy} when allowing for an increasing finite number of \emph{anomalies} of the hypothesized language by the learner compared with the language to be learned. In contrast to the vacillatory hierarchy for learning from solely positive information, we observe a \emph{duality} depending on whether infinitely many \emph{vacillations} between different (almost) correct hypotheses are still considered a successful learning behavior."

Until now a full analysis of all DFAs reaching this bound was only given for $n \leq 5$, and with bounds on the number of symbols for $n \leq 12$. Here we give the full analysis for $n \leq 7$, without bounds on the number of symbols.   For PFAs (partial automata) on $\leq 7$ states we do a similar analysis as for DFAs and find the maximal shortest synchronizing word lengths, exceeding $(n-1)^2$ for $n \geq 4$. Where DFAs with long synchronization typically have very few symbols, for PFAs we observe that more symbols may increase the synchronizing word length. For PFAs on $\leq 10$ states and two symbols we investigate all occurring synchronizing word lengths.   We give series of PFAs on two and three symbols, reaching the maximal possible length for some small values of $n$. For $n=6,7,8,9$, the construction on two symbols is the unique one reaching the maximal length. For both series the growth is faster than $(n-1)^2$, although still quadratic.   Based on string rewriting, for arbitrary size we construct a PFA on three symbols with exponential shortest synchronizing word length, giving significantly better bounds than earlier exponential constructions. We give a transformation of this PFA to a PFA on two symbols keeping exponential shortest synchronizing word length, yielding a better bound than applying a similar known transformation. Both PFAs are transitive.   Finally, we show that exponential lengths are even possible with just one single undefined transition, again with transitive constructions."

We also explore a method for proving these results using the automated theorem prover Walnut."

We investigate a notion of comparison between infinite strings. In a general way, if M is a computation model (e.g. Turing machines) and C a class of objects (e.g. languages), the complexity of an infinite word alpha can be measured with respect to the amount of objects from C that are presentable with machines from M using alpha as an oracle. In our case, the model M is finite automata and the objects C are either recognized languages or presentable structures, known respectively as advice regular languages and advice automatic structures. This leads to several different classifications of infinite words that are studied in detail; we also derive logical and computational equivalent measures. Our main results explore the connections between classes of advice automatic structures, MSO-transductions and two-way transducers. They suggest a closer study of the resulting hierarchy over infinite words."

We give a characterization of the subsets of a finite semigroup that are pointlike with respect to $\overline{\mathbf H}$. Our characterization is effective whenever $\mathbf H$ has a decidable membership problem. In particular, the separation problem for $\overline{\mathbf H}$-languages is decidable for any decidable variety of finite groups $\mathbf H$.

Checking that a program satisfies the data minimisation principle is not easy, even for the simple case when considering deterministic programs-as-functions. In this paper we prove (im)possibility results concerning runtime monitoring of (non-)minimality for deterministic programs both when the program has one input source (monolithic) and for the more general case when inputs come from independent sources (distributed case). We propose monitoring mechanisms where a monitor observes the inputs and the outputs of a program, to detect violation of data minimisation policies. We show that monitorability of (non) minimality is decidable only for specific cases, and detection of satisfaction of different notions of minimality in undecidable in general. That said, we show that under certain conditions monitorability is decidable and we provide an algorithm and a bound to check such properties in a pre-deployment controlled environment, also being able to compute a minimiser for the given program. Finally, we provide a proof-of-concept implementation for both offline and online monitoring and apply that to some case studies."

Every optimal squareful infinite word $s$ contains exactly six minimal squares and can be written as a product of these squares: $s = X_1^2 X_2^2 \cdots$. The square root $\sqrt{s}$ of $s$ is the infinite word $X_1 X_2 \cdots$ obtained by deleting half of each square. We proved that the square root map preserves the languages of Sturmian words (which are optimal squareful words). The dynamics of the square root map on a Sturmian subshift are well understood. In our earlier work, we introduced another type of subshift of optimal squareful words which together with the square root map form a dynamical system. In this paper, we study these dynamical systems in more detail and compare their properties to the Sturmian case. The main results are characterizations of periodic points and the limit set. The results show that while there is some similarity it is possible for the square root map to exhibit quite different behavior compared to the Sturmian case."

We show how the algebra, notably, allows us to also consider continuous-time traces and thereby facilitate models of hybrid systems. We then use this algebra to reconstruct the theory of reactive processes in our generic setting, and prove characteristic laws for sequential and parallel processes, all of which have been mechanically verified in the Isabelle/HOL proof assistant."

The array rules of such a system are labelled thus resulting in a labelled 8-directional array P system.

The system is shown to generate interesting pictures. The label language is compared with Chomsky hierarchy.

Here we deal with the correspondence relating positive $\mathcal C$-varieties of languages to positive $\mathcal C$-varieties of ordered automata and we present various specific instances of this correspondence.

In the course of this study, we also exhibit some connections between the algebraic structure of automaton (semi)groups and their dynamics on the boundary. First, we show that it is undecidable to check whether the group generated by a given invertible automaton has a positive relation, i.e. a relation p = 1 such that p only contains positive generators. Besides its obvious relation to the freeness of the group, the absence of positive relations has previously been studied and is connected to the triviality of some stabilizers of the boundary. We show that the emptiness of the set of positive relations is equivalent to the dynamical property that all (directed positive) orbital graphs centered at non-singular points are acyclic.   Gillibert showed that the finiteness problem for automaton semigroups is undecidable. In the second part of the paper, we show that this undecidability result also holds if the input is restricted to be bi-reversible and invertible (but, in general, not complete). As an immediate consequence, we obtain that the finiteness problem for automaton subsemigroups of semigroups generated by invertible, yet partial automata, so called automaton-inverse semigroups, is also undecidable.   Erratum: Contrary to a statement in a previous version of the paper, our approach does not show that that the freeness problem for automaton semigroups is undecidable.

Emergy, spelled with an 'm', defined as the amount of (solar) energy used to make a product or service, is becoming an important ecological indicator. The Maximum Empower Principle (MEP) was proposed as the fourth law of thermodynamics by the ecologist Odum in the 90's to explain observed self-organization of energy driven systems. But this principle suffers a lack of mathematical formulation due to an insufficiency of details about the underlying computation of empower (i.e. emergy per time).   For empower computation in steady-state an axiomatic basis has been developed recently by Le Corre and the second author of this paper. In this axiomatic basis emergy is defined as a recursive max-plus linear function.   Using this axiomatic basis and a correspondance between ecological theory and dynamic systems theory, we prove the MEP. In particular, we show that the empower computation in steady-state is equivalent to a combinatorial optimization problem."

2017-12-04 13:33:37+00:00,2017-12-04 13:33:37+00:00,"Complex Event Recognition (CER for short) refers to the activity of detecting patterns in streams of continuously arriving data. This field has been traditionally approached from a practical point of view, resulting in heterogeneous implementations with fundamentally different capabilities. The main reason behind this is that defining formal semantics for a CER language is not trivial: they usually combine first-order variables for joining and filtering events with regular operators like sequencing and Kleene closure. Moreover, their semantics usually focus only on the detection of complex events, leaving the concept of output mostly unattended.   In this paper, we propose to unify the semantics and output of complex event recognition languages by using second order objects. Specifically, we introduce a CER language called Second Order Complex Event Logic (SO-CEL for short), that uses second order variables for managing and outputting sequences of events. This makes the definition of the main CER operators simple, allowing us to develop the first steps in understanding its expressive power. We start by comparing SO-CEL with a version that uses first-order variables called FO-CEL, showing that they are equivalent in expressive power when restricted to unary predicates but, surprisingly, incomparable in general. Nevertheless, we show that if we restrict to sets of binary predicates, then SO-CEL is strictly more expressive than FO-CEL. Then, we introduce a natural computational model called Unary Complex Event Automata (UCEA) that provides a better understanding of SO-CEL. We show that, under unary predicates, SO-CEL captures the subclass of UCEA that satisfy the so-called *-property. Finally, we identify the operations that SO-CEL is lacking to capture UCEA and introduce a natural extension of the language that captures the complete class of UCEA under unary predicates."

Moreover we show that any regular expression can be turned into a dual feasible solution with an objective value that is equal to the size of the regular expression. For binomial languages we can relax the associated linear program using duality theorem.

In particular, we study linear dense-time properties that can be encoded by TAs with infinite acceptance criterion.First, we show that the problem of model-checking PTAs against deterministic-TA specifications can be solved through a product construction. Based on the product construction, we prove that the computational complexity of the problem with deterministic-TA specifications is EXPTIME-complete.

Theories of distributed systems consider equivalences fundamental, since they (1) preserve desirable correctness characteristics and (2) often allow for component substitution making compositional reasoning feasible. Modeling distributed systems often requires abstraction utilizing nondeterminism which induces unintended behaviors in terms of infinite executions with one nondeterministic choice being recurrently resolved, each time neglecting a single alternative. These situations are considered unrealistic or highly improbable. Fairness assumptions are commonly used to filter system behaviors, thereby distinguishing between realistic and unrealistic executions. This allows for key arguments in correctness proofs of distributed systems, which would not be possible otherwise. Our contribution is an equivalence spectrum in which fairness assumptions are preserved. The identified equivalences allow for (compositional) reasoning about correctness incorporating fairness assumptions."

This way, we construct an LTL formula, over old and new outputs and original inputs, which is realisable if, and only if, the original CTL* formula is realisable. The CTL*-via-LTL synthesis approach preserves the problem complexity, although it might increase the minimal system size.

This can be used to scale up applications of automata in formal verification tools and decision procedures for logical theories. The algorithms are based on new techniques for removing transitions (pruning) and adding transitions (saturation), as well as extensions of classic quotienting of the state space. These techniques use criteria based on combinations of backward and forward trace inclusions and simulation relations. Since trace inclusion relations are themselves PSPACE-complete, we introduce lookahead simulations as good polynomial time computable approximations thereof. Extensive experiments show that the average-case time complexity of our algorithms scales slightly above quadratically. (The space complexity is worst-case quadratic.) The size reduction of the automata depends very much on the class of instances, but our algorithm consistently reduces the size far more than all previous techniques. We tested our algorithms on NBA derived from LTL-formulae, NBA derived from mutual exclusion protocols and many classes of random NBA and NFA, and compared their performance to the well-known automata tool GOAL."

If in case of a tie a vertex always chooses blue color, it is called biased majority model. We are interested in the behavior of these deterministic processes, especially in a two-dimensional torus (i.e., cellular automaton with (biased) majority rule). In the present paper, as a main result we prove both majority and biased majority cellular automata exhibit a threshold behavior with two phase transitions. More precisely, it is shown that for a two-dimensional torus $T_{n,n}$, there are two thresholds $0\leq p_1, p_2\leq 1$ such that $p_b \ll p_1$, $p_1 \ll p_b \ll p_2$, and $p_2 \ll p_b$ result in monochromatic configuration by red, stable coexistence of both colors, and monochromatic configuration by blue, respectively in $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ number of steps"

A union-free language is deterministic if it can be accepted by a deterministic one-cycle-free-path finite automaton; this is an automaton which has one final state and exactly one cycle-free path from any state to the final state. Jir\'askov\'a and Masopust proved that the state complexities of the basic operations reversal, star, product, and boolean operations in deterministic union-free languages are exactly the same as those in the class of all regular languages. To prove that the bounds are met they used five types of automata, involving eight types of transformations of the set of states of the automata. We show that for each $n\ge 3$ there exists one ternary witness of state complexity $n$ that meets the bound for reversal and product. Moreover, the restrictions of this witness to binary alphabets meet the bounds for star and boolean operations. We also show that the tight upper bounds on the state complexity of binary operations that take arguments over different alphabets are the same as those for arbitrary regular languages. Furthermore, we prove that the maximal syntactic semigroup of a union-free language has $n^n$ elements, as in the case of regular languages, and that the maximal state complexities of atoms of union-free languages are the same as those for regular languages. Finally, we prove that there exists a most complex union-free language that meets the bounds for all these complexity measures. Altogether this proves that the complexity measures above cannot distinguish union-free languages from regular languages."

Our definition of pPDA allows both probabilistic and non-deterministic branching, generalising the classical notion of pushdown automata (without epsilon-transitions). We first show a general characterization of probabilistic bisimilarity in terms of two-player games, which naturally reduces checking bisimilarity of probabilistic labelled transition systems to checking bisimilarity of standard (non-deterministic) labelled transition systems. This reduction can be easily implemented in the framework of pPDA, allowing to use known results for standard (non-probabilistic) PDA and their subclasses. A direct use of the reduction incurs an exponential increase of complexity, which does not matter in deriving decidability of bisimilarity for pPDA due to the non-elementary complexity of the problem. In the cases of probabilistic one-counter automata (pOCA), of probabilistic visibly pushdown automata (pvPDA), and of probabilistic basic process algebras (i.e., single-state pPDA) we show that an implicit use of the reduction can avoid the complexity increase; we thus get PSPACE, EXPTIME, and 2-EXPTIME upper bounds, respectively, like for the respective non-probabilistic versions. The bisimilarity problems for OCA and vPDA are known to have matching lower bounds (thus being PSPACE-complete and EXPTIME-complete, respectively); we show that these lower bounds also hold for fully probabilistic versions that do not use non-determinism."

We compare this pseudovariety with several other natural pseudovarieties of ordered monoids and of monoids associated with the Burnside pseudovariety of groups defined by the identity $x^n=1$. In particular, we are interested in determining the pseudovariety of monoids that it generates, which can be viewed as the problem of determining the Boolean closure of the class of regular languages closed under $n$-power insertions. We exhibit a simple upper bound and show that it satisfies all pseudoidentities which are provable from $1\le x^n$ in which both sides are regular elements with respect to the upper bound."

We focus on the single-layer, ReLU-activation, rational-weight RNNs with softmax, which are commonly used in natural language processing applications. We show that most problems for such RNNs are undecidable, including consistency, equivalence, minimization, and the determination of the highest-weighted string. However, for consistent RNNs the last problem becomes decidable, although the solution length can surpass all computable bounds. If additionally the string is limited to polynomial length, the problem becomes NP-complete and APX-hard. In summary, this shows that approximations and heuristic algorithms are necessary in practical applications of those RNNs."
2017-11-10 19:29:02+00:00,2018-02-14 15:03:58+00:00,Unambiguous non-deterministic finite automata have intermediate expressive power and succinctness between deterministic and non-deterministic automata. It has been conjectured that every unambiguous non-deterministic one-way finite automaton (1UFA) recognizing some language L can be converted into a 1UFA recognizing the complement of the original language L with polynomial increase in the number of states. We disprove this conjecture by presenting a family of 1UFAs on a single-letter alphabet such that recognizing the complements of the corresponding languages requires superpolynomial increase in the number of states even for generic non-deterministic one-way finite automata. We also note that both the languages and their complements can be recognized by sweeping deterministic automata with a linear increase in the number of states.

Our results are as follows: a) We provide sufficient conditions on the output category so that minimization of the corresponding automata is guaranteed. b) We show how to lift adjunctions between the categories for output values to adjunctions between categories of automata. c) We show how this framework can be applied to several phenomena in automata theory, starting with determinization and minimization (previously studied from a coalgebraic and duality theoretic perspective). We apply in particular these techniques to Choffrut's minimization algorithm for subsequential transducers and revisit Brzozowski's minimization algorithm."

Some of these interconnections are well-known, while some are clarified in this study as a result of a fine-grained comparison between recursive formal systems, Turing machines, and Cellular Automata (CAs). In particular, we elaborate on the diagonalization argument applied to distributed computation carried out by CAs, illustrating the key elements of G\""odel's proof for CAs. The comparative analysis emphasizes three factors which underlie the capacity to generate undecidable dynamics within the examined computational frameworks: (i) the program-data duality; (ii) the potential to access an infinite computational medium; and (iii) the ability to implement negation. The considered adaptations of G\""odel's proof distinguish between computational universality and undecidability, and show how the diagonalization argument exploits, on several levels, the self-referential basis of undecidability."

We prove that deciding whether a partial DFA recognizes a birecurrent set is a PSPACE-complete problem.

A parameterized family defines an infinite-state system: for each number n, the family consists of an instance with n finite-state processes. In contrast to safety, the parameterized verification of liveness is currently still considered extremely challenging especially in the presence of probabilities in the model. One major challenge is to provide a sufficiently powerful symbolic framework. One well-known symbolic framework for the parameterized verification of non-probabilistic concurrent systems is regular model checking. Although the framework was recently extended to probabilistic systems, incorporating fairness in the framework - often crucial for verifying termination - has been especially difficult due to the presence of an infinite number of fairness constraints (one for each process). Our main contribution is a systematic, regularity-preserving, encoding of finitary fairness (a realistic notion of fairness proposed by Alur & Henzinger) in the framework of regular model checking for probabilistic parameterized systems. Our encoding reduces termination with finitary fairness to verifying parameterized termination without fairness over probabilistic systems in regular model checking (for which a verification framework already exists). We show that our algorithm could verify termination for many interesting examples from distributed algorithms (Herman's protocol) and evolutionary biology (Moran process, cell cycle switch), which do not hold under the standard notion of fairness. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first fully-automatic method that can prove termination for these examples."

The transformations we consider are expressed using deterministic finite automata (DFA) that read pairs of letters, one letter from the input and one from the output. The DFA corresponding to these transformations have additional constraints, ensuring that each input string is mapped to exactly one output string.   We suggest that, given a set of input/output examples, the smallest DFA consistent with the examples is a good candidate for the transformation the user was expecting. We therefore study the problem of, given a set of examples, finding a minimal DFA consistent with the examples and satisfying the functionality and totality constraints mentioned above.   We prove that, in general, this problem (the corresponding decision problem) is NP-complete. This is unlike the standard DFA minimization problem which can be solved in polynomial time. We provide several NP-hardness proofs that show the hardness of multiple (independent) variants of the problem.   Finally, we propose an algorithm for finding the minimal DFA consistent with input/output examples, that uses a reduction to SMT solvers. We implemented the algorithm, and used it to evaluate the likelihood that the minimal DFA indeed corresponds to the DFA expected by the user."

Many attempts are made to fight a state space explosion problem (for instance, compositional model checking). There are some methods of reduction of a state space based on independence of actions. However, in CSM model, which is based on coincidences rather than on interleaving, independence of actions cannot be defined. Therefore a state space reduction basing on identical temporal consequences rather than on independence of action is proposed. The new reduction is not as good as for interleaving systems, because all successors of a state (in depth of two levels) must be obtained before a reduction may be applied. This leads to reduction of space required for representation of a state space, but not in time of state space construction. Yet much savings may occur in regular state spaces for CSM systems."

We use this notion to design an approximate reduction procedure that achieves a great size reduction (much beyond the state-of-the-art language-preserving techniques) with a controlled and small error. We have implemented our approach and evaluated it on use cases from Snort, a popular NIDS.

Because there is no factor map from a lower entropy system to a higher entropy one, and there is no embedding of a higher entropy system into a lower entropy system, we also get as corollaries that the following decision problems are undecidable: Given two one-dimensional one-sided cellular automata $F$ and $G$ over a full shift: Are $F$ and $G$ conjugate? Is $F$ a factor of $G$? Is $F$ a subsystem of $G$? All of these are undecidable in both strong and weak variants (whether the homomorphism is required to commute with the shift or not, respectively).

The question is formalized using valence automata, an abstract model of automata in which the storage mechanism is given by a monoid. For each of a variety of storage mechanisms, one can choose a (typically infinite) monoid $M$ such that valence automata over $M$ are equivalent to (one-way) automata with this type of storage. In fact, many important storage mechanisms can be realized by monoids defined by finite graphs, called graph monoids. Examples include pushdown stacks, partially blind counters (which behave like Petri net places), blind counters (which may attain negative values), and combinations thereof.   Hence, we study for which graph monoids the emptiness problem for valence automata is decidable. A particular model realized by graph monoids is that of Petri nets with a pushdown stack. For these, decidability is a long-standing open question and we do not answer it here.   However, if one excludes subgraphs corresponding to this model, a characterization can be achieved. Moreover, we provide a description of those storage mechanisms for which decidability remains open. This leads to a model that naturally generalizes both pushdown Petri nets and the priority multicounter machines introduced by Reinhardt.   The cases that are proven decidable constitute a natural and apparently new extension of Petri nets with decidable reachability. It is finally shown that this model can be combined with another such extension by Atig and Ganty: We present a further decidability result that subsumes both of these Petri net extensions."

The standard approach for verifying such properties is by transforming LTL formulae to suitable $\omega$-automata and then applying model checking.   We revisit Vardi's transformation of an LTL formula to an alternating $\omega$-automaton and Wolper's LTL tableau method for satisfiability checking. We observe that both constructions effectively rely on a decomposition of formulae into linear factors.   Linear factors have been introduced previously by Antimirov in the context of regular expressions.   We establish the notion of linear factors for LTL and verify essential properties such as expansion and finiteness.   Our results shed new insights on the connection between the construction of alternating $\omega$-automata and semantic tableaux.

We find a tight upper bound on the state complexity of the binary operation \emph{overlap assembly} on regular languages. This operation was introduced by Csuhaj-Varj\'u, Petre, and Vaszil to model the process of self-assembly of two linear DNA strands into a longer DNA strand, provided that their ends ""overlap"". We prove that the state complexity of the overlap assembly of languages $L_m$ and $L_n$, where $m\ge 2$ and $n\ge1$, is at most $2 (m-1) 3^{n-1} + 2^n$. Moreover, for $m \ge 2$ and $n \ge 3$ there exist languages $L_m$ and $L_n$ over an alphabet of size $n$ whose overlap assembly meets the upper bound and this bound cannot be met with smaller alphabets.

The motivation for GFG automata comes from their adequacy for games and synthesis, wherein general nondeterminism is inappropriate. We continue the ongoing effort of studying the power of nondeterminism in GFG automata. Initial indications have hinted that every GFG automaton embodies a deterministic one. Today we know that this is not the case, and in fact GFG automata may be exponentially more succinct than deterministic ones.   We focus on the typeness question, namely the question of whether a GFG automaton with a certain acceptance condition has an equivalent GFG automaton with a weaker acceptance condition on the same structure. Beyond the theoretical interest in studying typeness, its existence implies efficient translations among different acceptance conditions. This practical issue is of special interest in the context of games, where the Buchi and co-Buchi conditions admit memoryless strategies for both players. Typeness is known to hold for deterministic automata and not to hold for general nondeterministic automata.   We show that GFG automata enjoy the benefits of typeness, similarly to the case of deterministic automata. In particular, when Rabin or Streett GFG automata have equivalent Buchi or co-Buchi GFG automata, respectively, then such equivalent automata can be defined on a substructure of the original automata. Using our typeness results, we further study the place of GFG automata in between deterministic and nondeterministic ones. Specifically, considering automata complementation, we show that GFG automata lean toward nondeterministic ones, admitting an exponential state blow-up in the complementation of a Streett automaton into a Rabin automaton, as opposed to the constant blow-up in the deterministic case."

Previously, deciding weak detectability (opacity, A-diagnosability) for monolithic systems was shown to be PSPACE-complete. In this paper, we study the complexity of deciding weak detectability (opacity, A-diagnosability) for modular systems. We show that the complexities of these problems are significantly worse than in the monolithic case. Namely, we show that deciding modular weak detectability (opacity, A-diagnosability) is EXPSPACE-complete.

In this paper, we show that it is not the case by considering DESs represented as deterministic finite automata without non-trivial cycles, which are structurally the simplest deadlock-free DESs. We show that even for such very simple DESs, checking weak (periodic) detectability remains intractable. On the contrary, we show that strong (periodic) detectability of DESs can be efficiently verified on a parallel computer."

We study the concept of synchronizing data words in RAs: does there exist a data word that sends all states of the RA to a single state?   For deterministic RAs with k registers (k-DRAs), we prove that inputting data words with 2k+1 distinct data from the infinite data domain is sufficient to synchronize. We show that the synchronization problem for DRAs is in general PSPACE-complete, and it is NLOGSPACE-complete for 1-DRAs. For nondeterministic RAs (NRAs), we show that Ackermann(n) distinct data (where n is the size of the RA) might be necessary to synchronize. The synchronization problem for NRAs is in general undecidable, however, we establish Ackermann-completeness of the problem for 1-NRAs.   Another main result is the NEXPTIME-completeness of the length-bounded synchronization problem for NRAs, where a bound on the length of the synchronizing data word, written in binary, is given. A variant of this last construction allows to prove that the length-bounded universality problem for NRAs is co-NEXPTIME-complete."

We investigate the corresponding enumeration problem, that is, given a graph and an RPQ, enumerate all paths in the graph that match the RPQ. We consider several versions of this problem, corresponding to different semantics of RPQs that have recently been considered: arbitrary paths, shortest paths, simple paths, and trails. Whereas arbitrary and shortest paths can be enumerated in polynomial delay, the situation is much more intricate for simple paths and trails. For instance, already the question if a given graph contains a simple path or trail of a certain length has cases with highly non-trivial solutions and cases that are long-standing open problems. In this setting, we study RPQ evaluation from a parameterized complexity perspective. We define a class of simple transitive expressions that is prominent in practice and for which we can prove two dichotomy-like results: one for simple paths and one for trails paths. We observe that, even though simple path semantics and trail semantics are intractable for RPQs in general, they are feasible for the vast majority of the kinds of RPQs that users use in practice. At the heart of this study is a result of independent interest on the parameterized complexity of finding disjoint paths in graphs: the two disjoint paths problem is W[1]-hard if parameterized by the length of one of the two paths."

Microstates are short duration quasi-stable states of the dynamically changing electrical field topographies recorded via an array of electrodes from the human scalp, and cluster into four canonical classes. The sequence of microstates observed under particular conditions can be considered an information source with unknown underlying structure. $\epsilon$-machines are discrete dynamical system automata with state-dependent probabilities on different future observations (in this case the next measured EEG microstate). They artificially reproduce underlying structure in an optimally predictive manner as generative models exhibiting dynamics emulating the behaviour of the source. Here we present experiments using both simulations and empirical data supporting the value of associating these discrete dynamical systems with mental states (e.g. mind-wandering, focused attention, etc.) and with clinical populations. The neurodynamics of mental states and clinical populations can then be further characterized by properties of these dynamical systems, including: i) statistical complexity (determined by the number of states of the corresponding $\epsilon$-automaton); ii) entropy rate; iii) characteristic sequence patterning (syntax, probabilistic grammars); iv) duration, persistence and stability of dynamical patterns; and v) algebraic measures such as Krohn-Rhodes complexity or holonomy length of the decompositions of these. The potential applications include the characterization of mental states in neurodynamic terms for mental health diagnostics, well-being interventions, human-machine interface, and others on both subject-specific and group/population-level."

Separation is usually investigated as a means to obtain a deep understanding of the class C.   In the paper, we are mainly interested in classes defined by logical formalisms. Such classes are often built on top of each other: given some logic, one builds a stronger one by adding new predicates to its signature. A natural construction is to enrich a logic with the successor relation. In this paper, we present a transfer result applying to this construction: we show that for suitable logically defined classes, separation for the logic enriched with the successor relation reduces to separation for the original logic. Our theorem also applies to a problem that is stronger than separation: covering. Moreover, we actually present two reductions: one for languages of finite words and the other for languages of infinite words."

In this paper, the knapsack problem for wreath products is studied. It turns out that decidability of knapsack is not preserved under wreath product. On the other hand, the class of knapsack-semilinear groups, where solutions sets of knapsack equations are effectively semilinear, is closed under wreath product. As a consequence, we obtain the decidability of knapsack for free solvable groups. Finally, it is shown that for every non-trivial abelian group $G$, knapsack (as well as the related subset sum problem) for the wreath product $G \wr \mathbb{Z}$ is NP-complete."

More precisely, since $L$ will in general be infinite, we should ask about the rate of growth of maximum antichains consisting of words of length $n$. This fundamental property of partial orders is known as the width, and in a companion work we show that the problem of computing the information leakage permitted by a deterministic interactive system modeled as a finite-state transducer can be reduced to the problem of computing the width of a certain regular language. In this paper, we show that if $L$ is regular then there is a dichotomy between polynomial and exponential antichain growth. We give a polynomial-time algorithm to distinguish the two cases, and to compute the order of polynomial growth, with the language specified as an NFA. For context-free languages we show that there is a similar dichotomy, but now the problem of distinguishing the two cases is undecidable. Finally, we generalise the lexicographic order to tree languages, and show that for regular tree languages there is a trichotomy between polynomial, exponential and doubly exponential antichain growth."

We study the various sets of directing words of fuzzy automata, prove that the directability properties are decidable, and show how such results can be deduced from the theory of directable nondeterministic automata. Moreover, we establish the closure properties of the different classes of directable fuzzy automata under the class operations of forming subautomata, homomorphic images and finite direct products."

This problem can exhibit high computational complexity, in particular when the automaton under analysis contains cycles that may be repeated very often (due to very high probabilities, e.g. p =0.999). Such cycles can degrade the performance of typical model checking algorithms, as the likelihood of repeating the cycle converges to zero arbitrarily slowly. We introduce an acceleration technique that can be applied to improve the execution of such cycles by collapsing their iterations. The acceleration process of a cyclic PTA consists of several formal steps necessary to handle the cumulative timing and probability information that result from successive executions of a cycle. The advantages of acceleration are twofold. First, it helps to reduce the computational complexity of the problem without adversely affecting the outcome of the analysis. Second, it can bring the ""worst case execution time"" problem of PTAs within the bounds of feasibility for model checking techniques. To our knowledge, this is the first work that addresses the problem of accelerating execution of cycles that exhibit both timing and probabilistic behavior."

An example of such an infinite family is a dining philosopher protocol with any number n of processes (n being the parameter that defines the infinite family). Regular model checking is a well-known generic framework for modelling parameterised concurrent systems, where an infinite set of configurations (resp. transitions) is represented by a regular set (resp. regular transducer). Although verifying safety properties in the regular model checking framework is undecidable in general, many sophisticated semi-algorithms have been developed in the past fifteen years that can successfully prove safety in many practical instances. In this paper, we propose a simple solution to synthesise regular inductive invariants that makes use of Angluin's classic L* algorithm (and its variants). We provide a termination guarantee when the set of configurations reachable from a given set of initial configurations is regular. We have tested L* algorithm on standard (as well as new) examples in regular model checking including the dining philosopher protocol, the dining cryptographer protocol, and several mutual exclusion protocols (e.g. Bakery, Burns, Szymanski, and German). Our experiments show that, despite the simplicity of our solution, it can perform at least as well as existing semi-algorithms."

In this paper, we propose a novel model of neural network based nonlinearWFA model (NL-WFA) along with a learning algorithm. Our learning algorithm is inspired by the spectral learning algorithm for WFAand relies on a nonlinear decomposition of the so-called Hankel matrix, by means of an auto-encoder network. The expressive power of NL-WFA and the proposed learning algorithm are assessed on both synthetic and real-world data, showing that NL-WFA can lead to smaller model sizes and infer complex grammatical structures from data."

Hence, it is appealing to assure the new system still preserves its safety properties. However, instead of inspecting the new system as a whole, which may result in a large state space, it is beneficial to reuse the verification results by inspecting the newly added component in isolation. To this aim, we study the problem of model checking component-based asynchronously communicating systems in the presence of an unspecified component against safety properties. Our solution is based on assume-guarantee reasoning, adopted for asynchronous environments, which generates the weakest assumption. If the newly added component conforms to the assumption, then the whole system still satisfies the property. To make the approach efficient and convergent, we produce an overapproximated interface of the missing component and by its composition with the rest of the system components, we achieve an overapproximated specification of the system, from which we remove those traces of the system that violate the property and generate an assumption for the missing component.   We have implemented our approach on two case studies. Furthermore, we compared our results with the state of the art direct approach. Our resulting assumptions are smaller in size and achieved faster."

We show that unfortunately this conjecture does not hold: there is no trade-off between bounds and memory, even for finite arenas.

While the first two classes satisfy a generalized closure property, namely, the complement of an {\omega}B-regular (resp., {\omega}S-regular) language is an {\omega}S-regular (resp., {\omega}B-regular) one, the last class is not closed under complementation. The existence of non-{\omega}BS-regular languages that are the complements of some {\omega}BS-regular ones and express fairly natural properties of reactive systems motivates the search for other well-behaved classes of extended {\omega}-regular languages. In this paper, we introduce the class of {\omega}T-regular languages, that includes meaningful languages which are not {\omega}BS-regular. We first define it in terms of {\omega}T-regular expressions.

We extend this idea to a general LTL framework, where we can use arbitrary LTL to deterministic automata translators for parts of formulas outside the mentioned fragments.

It has many potential applications, from program understanding and debugging to computing program reliability, compiler optimizations and quantitative information flow analysis for security. In these situations, it is usually more relevant to quantify the probability of satisfying/violating a given property than to just assess the possibility of such events to occur.   In this work, we introduce an approach for probabilistic analysis of open programs (i.e. programs with undefined identifiers) based on game semantics and model counting. We use a symbolic representation of algorithmic game semantics to collect the symbolic constraints on the input data (context) that lead to the occurrence of the target events (e.g. satisfaction/violation of a given property). The constraints are then analyzed to quantify how likely is an input to satisfy them. We use model counting techniques to count the number of solutions (from a bounded integer domain) that satisfy given constraints. These counts are then used to assign probabilities to program executions and to assess the probability for the target event to occur at the desired level of confidence. Finally, we present the results of applying our approach to several interesting examples and illustrate the benefits they may offer."

Finally, we revise the concept of quantum Turing machine with classical control introduced in [25]. The novelty of these machines consists in the fact that their termination problem is completely deterministic, in opposition to other notions in the literature.

We propose a revised operational semantics for the sequential composition operator in the context of intermediate termination.

One way to present this new class is by a type of regular expressions. The new expressions are an extension of $\omega$-regular expressions where two new variants of the Kleene star $L^*$ are added: $L^B$ and $L^S$. These new exponents are used to say that parts of the input word have bounded size, and that parts of the input can have arbitrarily large sizes, respectively. For instance, the expression $(a^Bb)^\omega$ represents the language of infinite words over the letters $a,b$ where there is a common bound on the number of consecutive letters $a$. The expression $(a^Sb)^\omega$ represents a similar language, but this time the distance between consecutive $b$'s is required to tend toward the infinite.   We develop a theory for these languages, with a focus on decidability and closure. We define an equivalent automaton model, extending B\""uchi automata. The main technical result is a complementation lemma that works for languages where only one type of exponent---either $L^B$ or $L^S$---is used.

In the realm of quantitative bounds a fundamental problem is to obtain asymptotic bounds on termination time. Large asymptotic bounds such as exponential or higher already suggest that either there is some error in modeling, or the model is not useful in practice. Hence we focus on polynomial asymptotic bounds for VASS. While some well-known approaches (e.g., lexicographic ranking functions) are neither sound nor complete with respect to polynomial bounds, other approaches only present sound methods for upper bounds. In this work our main contributions are as follows: First, for linear asymptotic bounds we present a sound and complete method for VASS, and moreover, our algorithm runs in polynomial time. Second, we classify VASS according the normals of the vectors of the cycles. We show that singularities in the normal are the key reason for asymptotic bounds such as exponential and non-elementary for VASS. In absence of singularities, we show that the asymptotic complexity bound is always polynomial and of the form ${\Theta}(n^k)$, for some k $\leq$ d. We present an algorithm, with time complexity polynomial in the size of the VASS and exponential in dimension d, to compute the optimal k."

A prototypical application of this technique decomposes a semigroup $T$ into a two-sided semidirect product whose components are built from two subsemigroups $T_1,T_2$, which together generate $T$, and the subsemigroup generated by their setwise product $T_1T_2$. In this sense we decompose $T$ by merging the subsemigroups $T_1$ and $T_2$. More generally, our technique merges semigroup homomorphisms from free semigroups."
2017-08-24 12:02:28+00:00,2017-08-24 12:02:28+00:00,We phrase parsing with context-free expressions as a type inhabitation problem where values are parse trees and types are context-free expressions. We first show how containment among context-free and regular expressions can be reduced to a reachability problem by using a canonical representation of states. The proofs-as-programs principle yields a computational interpretation of the reachability problem in terms of a coercion that transforms the parse tree for a context-free expression into a parse tree for a regular expression. It also yields a partial coercion from regular parse trees to context-free ones. The partial coercion from the trivial language of all words to a context-free expression corresponds to a predictive parser for the expression.
2017-08-24 00:39:55+00:00,2017-08-24 00:39:55+00:00,"Distributed programs are hard to get right because they are required to be open, scalable, long-running, and tolerant to faults. In particular, the recent approaches to distributed software based on (micro-)services where different services are developed independently by disparate teams exacerbate the problem. In fact, services are meant to be composed together and run in open context where unpredictable behaviours can emerge. This makes it necessary to adopt suitable strategies for monitoring the execution and incorporate recovery and adaptation mechanisms so to make distributed programs more flexible and robust. The typical approach that is currently adopted is to embed such mechanisms in the program logic, which makes it hard to extract, compare and debug. We propose an approach that employs formal abstractions for specifying failure recovery and adaptation strategies. Although implementation agnostic, these abstractions would be amenable to algorithmic synthesis of code, monitoring and tests. We consider message-passing programs (a la Erlang, Go, or MPI) that are gaining momentum both in academia and industry. Our research agenda consists of (1) the definition of formal behavioural models encompassing failures, (2) the specification of the relevant properties of adaptation and recovery strategy, (3) the automatic generation of monitoring, recovery, and adaptation logic in target languages of interest."
2017-08-22 00:52:31+00:00,2017-08-22 00:52:31+00:00,"Following some previous studies on restarting automata, we introduce a refined model - the h-lexicalized restarting automaton (h-RLWW). We argue that this model is useful for expressing lexicalized syntax in computational linguistics. We compare the input languages, which are the languages traditionally considered in automata theory, to the so-called basic and h-proper languages, which are (implicitly) used by categorial grammars, the original tool for the description of lexicalized syntax. The basic and h-proper languages allow us to stress several nice properties of h-lexicalized restarting automata, and they are suitable for modeling the analysis by reduction and, subsequently, for the development of categories of a lexicalized syntax. Based on the fact that a two-way deterministic monotone restarting automaton can be transformed into an equivalent deterministic monotone RL-automaton in (Marcus) contextual form, we obtain a transformation from monotone RLWW-automata that recognize the class CFL of context-free languages as their input languages to deterministic monotone h-RLWW-automata that recognize CFL through their h-proper languages. Through this transformation we obtain automata with the complete correctness preserving property and an infinite hierarchy within CFL, based on the size of the read/write window. Additionally, we consider h-RLWW-automata that are allowed to perform multiple rewrite steps per cycle, and we establish another infinite hierarchy above CFL that is based on the number of rewrite steps that may be executed within a cycle. The corresponding separation results and their proofs illustrate the transparency of h-RLWW-automata that work with the (complete or cyclic) correctness preserving property"

While in traditional WK automata both heads read the whole input in the same physical direction, in 5'->3' WK automata the heads start from the two extremes and read the input in opposite direction. In sensing 5'->3' WK automata the process on the input is finished when the heads meet. Since the heads of a WK automaton may read longer strings in a transition, in previous models a so-called sensing parameter took care for the proper meeting of the heads (not allowing to read the same positions of the input in the last step). In this paper, a new model is investigated, which works without the sensing parameter (it is done by an appropriate change of the concept of configuration). Consequently, the accepted language classes of the variants are also changed. Various hierarchy results are proven in the paper."

These devices and their accepted languages are called k-reversible automata and k-reversible languages, respectively. The existence of k-reversible languages which are not (k-1)-reversible is known, for each k>1. This gives an infinite hierarchy of weakly irreversible languages, i.e., languages which are k-reversible for some k. Conditions characterizing the class of k-reversible languages, for each fixed k, and the class of weakly irreversible languages are obtained. From these conditions, a procedure that given a finite automaton decides if the accepted language is weakly or strongly (i.e., not weakly) irreversible is described. Furthermore, a construction which allows to transform any finite automaton which is not k-reversible, but which accepts a k-reversible language, into an equivalent k-reversible finite automaton, is presented."

A double-head pushdown automaton is a slight generalization of an ordinary pushdown automaton working with two input heads that move in opposite directions on the common input tape. In every step one head is moved and the automaton decides on acceptance if the heads meet. Demanding the automaton to work input-driven it is required that every input symbol uniquely defines the action on the pushdown store (push, pop, state change). Normally this is modeled by a partition of the input alphabet and is called a signature. Since our automaton model works with two heads either both heads respect the same signature or each head owes its own signature. This results in two variants of input-driven double-head pushdown automata. The induced language families on input-driven double-head pushdown automata are studied from the perspectives of their language describing capability, their closure properties, and decision problems."

In case the basic semiring is the Boolean semiring or the semiring of natural numbers (augmented with infinity), we show that there exists a mixed context-free grammar that generates ||P||.

So classifying such sets, with parameters k and n, as avoidable or unavoidable becomes an interesting problem. In this paper, we work towards this classification problem by investigating the maximum number of holes we can fill in unavoidable sets of partial words of uniform length over an alphabet of any fixed size, while maintaining the unavoidability property."

With the set maximal mode, computational completeness can already be obtained with tissue P systems having a tree structure, whereas tissue P systems even with an arbitrary communication structure are not computationally complete when working in the sequential mode. Adding polarizations (-1, 0, 1 are sufficient) allows for obtaining computational completeness even for tissue P systems working in the sequential mode."

Each set of nonnegative integers is represented in base $b$ by a language over $\{0, 1, \dots, b - 1\}$. The set is said to be $b$-recognisable if it is represented by a regular language. It is known that ultimately periodic sets are $b$-recognisable, for every base $b$, and Cobham's theorem implies the converse: no other set is $b$-recognisable in every base $b$.   We consider the following decision problem: let $S$ be a set of nonnegative integers that is $b$-recognisable, given as a finite automaton over $\{0,1, \dots, b - 1\}$, is $S$ periodic? Honkala showed in 1986 that this problem is decidable. Later on, Leroux used in 2005 the convention to write number representations with the least significant digit first (LSDF), and designed a quadratic algorithm to solve a more general problem.   We use here LSDF convention as well and give a structural description of the minimal automata that accept periodic sets. Then, we show that it can be verified in linear time if a minimal automaton meets this description. In general, this yields a $O(b \log(n))$ procedure to decide whether an automaton with $n$ states accepts an ultimately periodic set of nonnegative integers."

In addition to the standard operations (resetting clocks, checking guards of clocks) each automaton can either (1) append a message to the tail of a channel with an initial age or (2) receive the message at the head of a channel if its age satisfies a set of given constraints. In this paper, we show that the reachability problem is undecidable even in the case of two timed automata connected by one unidirectional timed channel if one allows global clocks (that the two automata can check and manipulate). We prove that this undecidability still holds even for CTA consisting of three timed automata and two unidirectional timed channels (and without any global clock). However, the reachability problem becomes decidable (in $\mathsf{EXPTIME}$) in the case of two automata linked with one unidirectional timed channel and with no global clock. Finally, we consider the bounded-context case, where in each context, only one timed automaton is allowed to receive messages from one channel while being able to send messages to all the other timed channels. In this case we show that the reachability problem is decidable."

We first show how to represent linear hybrid automata with convex invariants by an action language modulo theories. A further translation into SMT allows for computing them using SMT solvers that support arithmetic over reals. Next, we extend the representation to the general class of non-linear hybrid automata allowing even non-convex invariants. We represent them by an action language modulo ODE (Ordinary Differential Equations), which can be compiled into satisfiability modulo ODE.

The current investigations propose resource bounds that restrict the generative power of SCG to a subset of context sensitive languages and present a strong finite-state condition for grammars as wholes.

At its core PAWS is based on a generic implementation of algorithms for checking language equivalence in weighted automata and bisimulation in conditional transition systems. This architecture allows for the use of arbitrary user-defined semirings. New semirings can be generated during run-time and the user can rely on numerous automatisation techniques to create new semiring structures for PAWS' algorithms. Basic semirings such as distributive complete lattices and fields of fractions can be defined by specifying few parameters, more exotic semirings can be generated from other semirings or defined from scratch using a built-in semiring generator. In the most general case, users can define new semirings by programming (in C#) the base operations of the semiring and a procedure to solve linear equations and use their newly generated semiring in the analysis tools that PAWS offers."

We approach this NP-complete problem by introducing a novel variant of two-way multihead automata, which reveals that the complexity of the match test is determined by a hidden combinatorial property of extended regular expressions, and it shows that a restriction of the corresponding parameter leads to rich classes with a polynomial time match test. For presentational reasons, we use the concept of pattern languages in order to specify extended regular expressions. While this decision, formally, slightly narrows the scope of our results, an extension of our concepts and results to more general notions of extended regular expressions is straightforward."

In this paper, we study the reachability problem for non-convex state spaces and show that this problem is in general undecidable.

Every multiple context-free tree grammar that is finitely ambiguous can be lexicalized; i.e., it can be transformed into an equivalent one (generating the same tree language) in which each rule of the grammar contains a lexical symbol. Due to this transformation, the rank of the nonterminals increases at most by 1, and the multiplicity (or fan-out) of the grammar increases at most by the maximal rank of the lexical symbols; in particular, the multiplicity does not increase when all lexical symbols have rank 0. Multiple context-free tree grammars have the same tree generating power as multi-component tree adjoining grammars (provided the latter can use a root-marker). Moreover, every multi-component tree adjoining grammar that is finitely ambiguous can be lexicalized. Multiple context-free tree grammars have the same string generating power as multiple context-free (string) grammars and polynomial time parsing algorithms. A tree language can be generated by a multiple context-free tree grammar if and only if it is the image of a regular tree language under a deterministic finite-copying macro tree transducer. Multiple context-free tree grammars can be used as a synchronous translation device."
2017-07-11 14:25:08+00:00,2018-11-15 16:48:58+00:00,"We investigate a famous decision problem in automata theory: separation. Given a class of language C, the separation problem for C takes as input two regular languages and asks whether there exists a third one which belongs to C, includes the first one and is disjoint from the second. Typically, obtaining an algorithm for separation yields a deep understanding of the investigated class C. This explains why a lot of effort has been devoted to finding algorithms for the most prominent classes.   Here, we are interested in classes within concatenation hierarchies. Such hierarchies are built using a generic construction process: one starts from an initial class called the basis and builds new levels by applying generic operations. The most famous one, the dot-depth hierarchy of Brzozowski and Cohen, classifies the languages definable in first-order logic. Moreover, it was shown by Thomas that it corresponds to the quantifier alternation hierarchy of first-order logic: each level in the dot-depth corresponds to the languages that can be defined with a prescribed number of quantifier blocks. Finding separation algorithms for all levels in this hierarchy is among the most famous open problems in automata theory.   Our main theorem is generic: we show that separation is decidable for the level 3/2 of any concatenation hierarchy whose basis is finite. Furthermore, in the special case of the dot-depth, we push this result to the level 5/2. In logical terms, this solves separation for $\Sigma_3$: first-order sentences having at most three quantifier blocks starting with an existential one."

Time is modeled using clock variables, and recursion using stacks. Our technique consists of modeling the behaviours of the timed system as graphs, and interpreting these graphs on tree terms by showing a bound on their tree-width. We then build a tree automaton that accepts exactly those tree terms that describe realizable runs of the timed system. The emptiness of the timed system thus boils down to emptiness of a finite tree automaton that accepts these tree terms. This approach helps us in obtaining an optimal complexity, not just in theory (as done in earlier work), but also in going towards an efficient implementation of our technique. To do this, we make several improvements in the theory and exploit these to build a first prototype tool that can analyze timed systems with recursion."
2017-07-07 07:11:06+00:00,2017-07-07 07:11:06+00:00,"We introduce a new setting where a population of agents, each modelled by a finite-state system, are controlled uniformly: the controller applies the same action to every agent. The framework is largely inspired by the control of a biological system, namely a population of yeasts, where the controller may only change the environment common to all cells. We study a synchronisation problem for such populations: no matter how individual agents react to the actions of the controller , the controller aims at driving all agents synchronously to a target state. The agents are naturally represented by a non-deterministic finite state automaton (NFA), the same for every agent, and the whole system is encoded as a 2-player game. The first player (Controller) chooses actions, and the second player (Agents) resolves non-determinism for each agent. The game with m agents is called the m-population game. This gives rise to a parameterized control problem (where control refers to 2 player games), namely the population control problem: can Controller control the m-population game for all $m $\in$ N$ whatever Agents does? In this paper, we prove that the population control problem is decidable, and it is a EXPTIME-complete problem. As far as we know, this is one of the first results on parameterized control. Our algorithm, not based on cutoff techniques, produces winning strategies which are symbolic, that is, they do not need to count precisely how the population is spread between states. We also show that if there is no winning strategy, then there is a population size M such that Controller wins the m-population game if and only if $m $\le$ M$. Surprisingly, M can be doubly exponential in the number of states of the NFA, with tight upper and lower bounds."

Since these operators are not explicitly defined in the classic formal language theory, it is significant and still challenging to argue PEGs' expressiveness in the context of formal language theory.Since PEGs are relatively new, there are several unsolved problems.One of the problems is revealing a subclass of PEGs that is equivalent to DFAs. This allows application of some techniques from the theory of regular grammar to PEGs. In this paper, we define Linear PEGs (LPEGs), a subclass of PEGs that is equivalent to DFAs. Surprisingly, LPEGs are formalized by only excluding some patterns of recursive nonterminal in PEGs, and include the full set of ordered choice, unlimited lookahead, and greedy repetition, which are characteristic of PEGs. Although the conversion judgement of parsing expressions into DFAs is undecidable in general, the formalism of LPEGs allows for a syntactical judgement of parsing expressions."

We settle the decidability status of the above four problems for all combinations of hierarchy, inhibitor, reset and transfer arcs, except the termination problem for two combinations. For both these combinations, we show that the termination problem is as hard as deciding positivity for linear recurrent sequences -- a long-standing open problem."

A transduction T is said to be height bounded memory (HBM) if it can be evaluated with a memory that depends only on the size of T and on the height of the input word. We show that it is decidable in coNPTime for a nested word transduction defined by a visibly pushdown transducer (VPT), if it is HBM. In this case, the required amount of memory may depend exponentially on the height of the word. We exhibit a sufficient, decidable condition for a VPT to be evaluated with a memory that depends quadratically on the height of the word. This condition defines a class of transductions that strictly contains all determinizable VPTs."

The first obvious answer is that each of these notions relates to topics of interest for WORDS: Church-Rosser systems are certain rewriting systems over words, codes are given by sets of words which form a basis of a free submonoid in the free monoid of all words (over a given alphabet) and local Rees extensions provide structural insight into regular languages over words. So, it seems to be a legitimate title for an extended abstract presented at the conference WORDS 2017. However, this work is more ambitious, it outlines some less obvious but much more interesting link between these topics. This link is based on a structure theory of finite monoids with varieties of groups and the concept of local divisors playing a prominent role. Parts of this work appeared in a similar form in conference proceedings where proofs and further material can be found."

We prove, using a decision procedure based on automata, that every natural number is the sum of at most 4 natural numbers whose base-2 representation is a palindrome. Here the constant 4 is optimal. We obtain similar results for bases 3 and 4, thus completely resolving the problem.   We consider some other variations on this problem, and prove similar results. We argue that heavily case-based proofs are a good signal that a decision procedure may help to automate the proof."

There one is given a log $w$ and a specification $\mathcal{A}$ (given by a timed word and a timed automaton in this paper), and one wishes to return the set of intervals for which the log $w$, when restricted to the interval, satisfies the specification $\mathcal{A}$. In our previous work we presented an efficient timed pattern matching algorithm: it adopts a skipping mechanism inspired by the classic Boyer--Moore (BM) string matching algorithm. In this work we tackle the problem of online timed pattern matching, towards embedded applications where it is vital to process a vast amount of incoming data in a timely manner. Specifically, we start with the Franek-Jennings-Smyth (FJS) string matching algorithm---a recent variant of the BM algorithm---and extend it to timed pattern matching. Our experiments indicate the efficiency of our FJS-type algorithm in online and offline timed pattern matching."

We show that important decision problems such as emptiness, universality and comparison are PSpace-c for these expressions. We then investigate the extension of these expressions with Kleene star. This allows to iterate an expression over smaller fragments of the input word, and to combine the results by taking their iterated sum. The decision problems turn out to be undecidable, but we introduce the decidable and still expressive class of synchronised expressions."

Previous works have considered NWA that processed input words only in the forward direction. It is natural to allow the automata to process input words backwards as well, for example, to measure the maximal or average time between a response and the preceding request. We therefore introduce and study bidirectional NWA that can process input words in both directions. First, we show that bidirectional NWA can express interesting quantitative properties that are not expressible by forward-only NWA. Second, for the fundamental decision problems of emptiness and universality, we establish decidability and complexity results for the new framework which match the best-known results for the special case of forward-only NWA. Thus, for NWA, the increased expressiveness of bidirectionality is achieved at no additional computational complexity. This is in stark contrast to the unweighted case, where bidirectional finite automata are no more expressive but exponentially more succinct than their forward-only counterparts."

First, we show that there is a family of PDAs over a unary alphabet with $n$ states and $p \geq 2n + 4$ stack symbols that accepts one single long word for which every equivalent context-free grammar needs $\Omega(n^2(p-2n-4))$ variables. This family shows that the classical algorithm for converting a PDA to an equivalent context-free grammar is optimal even when the alphabet is unary. Moreover, we observe that language equivalence and Parikh equivalence, which ignores the ordering between symbols, coincide for this family. We conclude that, when assuming this weaker equivalence, the conversion algorithm is also optimal. Second, Parikh's theorem motivates the comparison of PDAs against finite state automata. In particular, the same family of unary PDAs gives a lower bound on the number of states of every Parikh-equivalent finite state automaton. Finally, we look into the case of unary deterministic PDAs. We show a new construction converting a unary deterministic PDA into an equivalent context-free grammar that achieves best known bounds."

Decentralization is an effective way to design and manage the complexity of modern self-adaptive software systems. However, there are still tremendous challenges. One major challenge is to unify decentrality with traditional self-adaptive implementation framework during design and implementation activity. One is to guarantee the required global goals and performance of decentralized self-adaptive systems operating in highly dynamic and uncertain environments. Another challenge is to predict the influence of system's internal change on its self-adaptability to the environment. To solve these problems, we combine the mechanisms of separation of concerns with modeling method using timed automata to allow the system to be analyzed and verified. Timed computation tree logic is used to specify system goals and stochastic simulations in dynamic environment are experimented to verify decentralized self-adaptive system's adaptation properties. In this paper, we extracted a motivation example from practical applications in UAV emergency mission scenarios. The whole approach is evaluated and illustrated with this motivation example and the statistical results can be used as reference for arrangement planning of UAVs in cyber physical spaces."

This work is a contribution to the study of the set of the representations of integers. This prefix-closed subset of the free monoid is naturally represented as a highly non-regular tree. Its nodes are the integers, its edges bear labels taken in {0,1,...,p-1}, and its subtrees are all distinct.   We associate with each subtree (or with its root n) three infinite words. The bottom word of n is the lexicographically smallest word that is the label of a branch of the subtree. The top word of n is defined similarly. The span-word of n is the digitwise difference between the latter and the former.   First, we show that the set of all the span-words is accepted by an infinite automaton whose underlying graph is essentially the same as the tree itself. Second, we study the function that computes for all n the bottom word associated with n+1 from the one associated with n, and show that it is realised by an infinite sequential transducer whose underlying graph is once again essentially the same as the tree itself.   An infinite word may be interpreted as an expansion in base p/q after the radix point, hence evaluated to a real number. If T is a subtree whose root is n, then the evaluations of the labels of the branches of T form an interval of $\mathbb{R}$. The length of this interval is called the span of n and is equal to the evaluation of the span-word of n. The set of all spans is then a subset of R and we use the preceding construction to study its topological closure. We show that it is an interval when p is greater than or equal to 2q-1, and a Cantor set of measure zero otherwise."

To construct this quasi-solution we introduce signal machines over continuum representations of such multigraphs and construct a signal machine whose discretisation is a cellular automaton that quasi-solves the problem. This automaton uses a time-optimal solution of the firing squad synchronisation problem in dimension one with one general at one end to synchronise edges, and freezes and thaws the synchronisation of edges in such a way that all edges synchronise at the same time."

This statement is known as Garden of Eden theorem. Pre-Injectivity means that two global configurations that differ at most on a finite subset and have the same image under the global transition function must be identical.

Unfortunately, this is not always possible, mainly because of two reasons: (i) the model is still under development and (ii) the correctness of implementation of some modules is not established. In such circumstances, is it still possible to get correct answers for some model checking queries?   This paper is a step towards answering this question. We formulate this problem for the Discrete Time Markov Chains (DTMC) modeling formalism and the Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL) query language. We then propose a simple solution by modifying DTMC and PCTL to accommodate three valued logic. The technique builds on existing model checking algorithms and tools, obviating the need for new ones to account for three valued logic.   One of the most useful and popular techniques for modeling complex systems is through discrete event simulation. Discrete event simulators are essentially code in some programming language.

This concerns namely techniques for size reduction and language inclusion testing, which are two problems that are crucial for many applications of tree automata. For size reduction of tree automata, we adapt the simulation quotient technique that is well established for finite word automata. We give efficient algorithms for computing tree automata simulations and we also introduce a new type of relation that arises from a combination of tree automata downward and upward simulation and that is very well suited for quotienting. The combination principle is relevant also for word automata. We then generalise the so called antichain universality and language inclusion checking technique developed originally for finite word automata for tree automata. Subsequently, we improve the antichain technique for both word and tree automata by combining it with the simulation-based inclusion checking techniques, significantly improving efficiency of the antichain method. We then show how the developed reduction and inclusion checking methods improve the method of abstract regular tree model checking, the method that was the original motivation for starting the work on tree automata. Both the reduction and the language inclusion methods are based on relatively simple and general principles that can be further extended for other types of automata and related formalisms. An example is our adaptation of the reduction methods for alternating B\""uchi automata, which results in an efficient alternating automata size reduction technique."

We are interested in the case where these functions are sparse (that is, for most sequences they return 0). Spectral algorithms reduce the learning problem to the task of computing an SVD decomposition over a special type of matrix called the Hankel matrix. This matrix is designed to capture the relevant statistics of the training sequences. What is crucial is that to capture long range dependencies we must consider very large Hankel matrices. Thus the computation of the SVD becomes a critical bottleneck. Our solution finds a subset of rows and columns of the Hankel that realizes a compact and informative Hankel submatrix. The novelty lies in the way that this subset is selected: we exploit a maximal bipartite matching combinatorial algorithm to look for a sub-block with full structural rank, and show how computation of this sub-block can be further improved by exploiting the specific structure of Hankel matrices."

We provide an algorithm of different flavor solving the above question, that has doubly exponential space complexity. In the special case of sweeping transducers the complexity is one exponential less. We also show how to construct an equivalent one-way transducer, whenever it exists, in doubly or triply exponential time, again depending on whether the input transducer is sweeping or two-way. In the sweeping case our construction is shown to be optimal."

Specifically, the global mission is decomposed into local tasks; and local mission supervisors are designed to accomplish these local tasks while maintaining the multi-agent performance by integrating supervisor synthesis with compositional verification techniques; finally, motion plans are automatically synthesized based on the obtained mission plans. We present three modifications of the L* learning algorithm such that they are adapted for the synthesis of the local mission supervisors, the compositional verification and the synthesis of local motion plans, to guarantee that the collective behavior of the agents will ensure the satisfaction of the global specification. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated by a detailed experimental study based on the implementation of a multi-robot coordination scenario. The proposed hardware-software architecture, with each robot's communication and localization capabilities, is exploited to examine the automatic supervisor synthesis with inter-robot communication."

There are many models of accepting devices for which there is no difference with these problems between deterministic and nondeterministic versions, and the same holds for the emptiness problem. As far as we know, the model we introduce above is the first one-way model to exhibit properties (1) and (2). We define another family of one-way acceptors where the nondeterministic version has an undecidable emptiness problem, but the deterministic version has a decidable emptiness problem. We also know of no other model with this property in the literature. We also investigate decidability properties of other variations of checking stack automata (e.g., allowing multiple stacks, two-way input, etc.).

OP languages are based on three relations between any two consecutive terminal symbols, which assign syntax structure to words. We extend such relations to k-tuples of consecutive terminal symbols, by using the model of strictly locally testable regular languages of order k at least 3. The new corresponding class of Higher-order Operator Precedence languages (HOP) properly includes the OP languages, and it is still included in the deterministic (also in reverse) context free family. We prove Boolean closure for each subfamily of structurally compatible HOP languages. In each subfamily, the top language is called max-language. We show that such languages are defined by a simple cancellation rule and we prove several properties, in particular that max-languages make an infinite hierarchy ordered by parameter k. HOP languages are a candidate for replacing OP languages in the various applications where they have have been successful though sometimes too restrictive."

The game has a predetermined (possibly finite) choice sequence $\alpha_1$, $\alpha_2$, $\ldots$ of integers such that on round $n$ the player $A$ chooses a subset $S_n$ of size $\alpha_n$ of some fixed finite alphabet and the player $B$ picks a letter from the set $S_n$. The outcome is determined by whether the word obtained by concatenating the letters $B$ picked lies in a prescribed target set $X$ (a win for player $A$) or not (a win for player $B$). Typically, we consider $X$ to be a subshift. The winning shift $W(X)$ of a subshift $X$ is defined as the set of choice sequences for which $A$ has a winning strategy when the target set is the language of $X$. The winning shift $W(X)$ mirrors some properties of $X$. For instance, $W(X)$ and $X$ have the same entropy. Virtually nothing is known about the structure of the winning shifts of subshifts common in combinatorics on words. In this paper, we study the winning shifts of subshifts generated by marked uniform substitutions, and show that these winning shifts, viewed as subshifts, also have a substitutive structure. Particularly, we give an explicit description of the winning shift for the generalized Thue-Morse substitutions. It is known that $W(X)$ and $X$ have the same factor complexity. As an example application, we exploit this connection to give a simple derivation of the first difference and factor complexity functions of subshifts generated by marked substitutions. We describe these functions in particular detail for the generalized Thue-Morse substitutions."

However, unlike term rewriting, rewriting string diagrams results in shorter equational proofs, because the string diagrammatic representation allows us to formally establish equalities modulo any rewrite steps which follow from the monoidal structure.   Manipulating string diagrams by hand is a time-consuming and error-prone process, especially for large string diagrams. This can be ameliorated by using software proof assistants, such as Quantomatic.   However, reasoning about concrete string diagrams may be limiting and in some scenarios it is necessary to reason about entire (infinite) families of string diagrams. When doing so, we face the same problems as for manipulating concrete string diagrams, but in addition, we risk making further mistakes if we are not precise enough about the way we represent (infinite) families of string diagrams.   The primary goal of this thesis is to design a mathematical framework for equational reasoning about infinite families of string diagrams which is amenable to computer automation. We will be working with context-free families of string diagrams and we will represent them using context-free graph grammars. We will model equations between infinite families of diagrams using rewrite rules between context-free grammars. Our framework represents equational reasoning about concrete string diagrams and context-free families of string diagrams using double-pushout rewriting on graphs and context-free graph grammars respectively. We will prove that our representation is sound by showing that it respects the concrete semantics of string diagrammatic reasoning and we will show that our framework is appropriate for software implementation by proving important decidability properties."

This directly generalizes the well-studied problem of determining the worst-case state complexity of reversals of ordinary deterministic finite automata. If a DFAO has $n$ states and $k$ possible output values, there is a known upper bound of $k^n$ for the state complexity of reversal. We show this bound can be reached with a ternary input alphabet. We conjecture it cannot be reached with a binary input alphabet except when $k = 2$, and give a lower bound for the case $3 \le k < n$. We prove that the state complexity of reversal depends solely on the transition monoid of the DFAO and the mapping that assigns output values to states."

A pomset is a generalisation of a word over an alphabet in that letters may be partially ordered. A term $t$ using the bi-Kleene operations $0,1, +, \cdot\, ,^*, \parallel, ^{(*)}$ defines a language $ \mathopen{[\![ } t \mathclose{]\!] } $ of pomsets in a natural way.   We prove that every valid universal equality over pomset languages using these operations is a consequence of the equational theory of regular languages (in which parallel multiplication and iteration are undefined) plus that of the commutative-regular languages (in which sequential multiplication and iteration are undefined). We also show that the class of $\textit{rational}$ pomset languages (that is, those languages generated from singleton pomsets using the bi-Kleene operations) is closed under all Boolean operations.   An $ \textit{ideal}$ of a pomset $p$ is a pomset using the letters of $p$, but having an ordering at least as strict as $p$. A bi-Kleene term $t$ thus defines the set $ \textbf{Id} (\mathopen{[\![ } t \mathclose{]\!] }) $ of ideals of pomsets in $ \mathopen{[\![ } t \mathclose{]\!] } $. We prove that if $t$ does not contain commutative iteration $^{(*)}$ (in our terminology, $t$ is bw-rational) then $\textbf{Id} (\mathopen{[\![ } t \mathclose{]\!] }) \cap \textbf{Pom}_{sp}$, where $ \textbf{Pom}_{sp}$ is the set of pomsets generated from singleton pomsets using sequential and parallel multiplication ($ \cdot$ and $ \parallel$) is defined by a bw-rational term, and if two such terms $t,t'$ define the same ideal language, then $t'=t$ is provable from the Kleene axioms for $0,1, +, \cdot\, ,^*$ plus the commutative idempotent semiring axioms for $0,1, +, \parallel$ plus the exchange law $ (u \parallel v)\cdot ( x \parallel y) \le v \cdot y \parallel u \cdot x $."

In this paper we consider alternating automata over infinite alphabets, whose transition rules are formulae in a combined theory of booleans and some infinite data domain, that relate past and current values of the data variables. The data theory is not fixed, but rather it is a parameter of the class. We show that union, intersection and complementation are possible in linear time in this model and, though the emptiness problem is undecidable, we provide two efficient semi-algorithms, inspired by two state-of-the-art abstraction refinement model checking methods: lazy predicate abstraction \cite{HJMS02} and the \impact~ semi-algorithm \cite{mcmillan06}.

In particular, their algebraic characterization by aperiodic congruences allows to decide whether a regular language is aperiodic.   We lift this decidability result to rational transductions, i.e., word-to-word functions defined by finite state transducers. In this context, logical and algebraic characterizations have also been proposed. Our main result is that one can decide if a rational transduction (given as a transducer) is in a given decidable congruence class.

We study upper and lower bounds on the height of maximal finite towers with respect to the size of the NFA (the DFA) representation of the languages. We show that the upper bound is polynomial in the number of states and exponential in the size of the alphabet, and that it is asymptotically tight if the size of the alphabet is fixed. If the alphabet may grow, then, using an alphabet of size approximately the number of states of the automata, the lower bound on the height of towers is exponential with respect to that number. In this case, there is a gap between the lower and upper bound, and the asymptotically optimal bound remains an open problem. Since, in many cases, the constructed towers are sequences of prefixes, we also study towers of prefixes."

For instance, the language of primitives in the free group on two generators, the Bridson-Gilman normal forms for the fundamental groups of 3-manifolds or orbifolds, and the co-word problem of Grigorchuk's group can be generated by L systems.

When restricted to the appropriate families of graphs, these forgetful automata are equivalent to classical finite word automata, but strictly more expressive than finite tree automata. On the other hand, we also show that the emptiness problem is undecidable in general. This already holds for two heavily restricted classes of distributed automata: those that reject immediately if they receive more than one message per round, and those whose state diagram must be acyclic except for self-loops."

Thanks to their simplicity they enjoy various nice algebraic and logic properties that have been successfully exploited in many application fields. Practically all of their related problems are decidable, so that they support automatic verification algorithms. Also, they can be recognized in real-time.   Context-free languages (CFL) are another major family well-suited to formalize programming, natural, and many other classes of languages; their increased generative power w.r.t. RL, however, causes the loss of several closure properties and of the decidability of important problems; furthermore they need complex parsing algorithms. Thus, various subclasses thereof have been defined with different goals, spanning from efficient, deterministic parsing to closure properties, logic characterization and automatic verification techniques.   Among CFL subclasses, so-called structured ones, i.e., those where the typical tree-structure is visible in the sentences, exhibit many of the algebraic and logic properties of RL, whereas deterministic CFL have been thoroughly exploited in compiler construction and other application fields.   After surveying and comparing the main properties of those various language families, we go back to operator precedence languages (OPL), an old family through which R. Floyd pioneered deterministic parsing, and we show that they offer unexpected properties in two fields so far investigated in totally independent ways: they enable parsing parallelization in a more effective way than traditional sequential parsers, and exhibit the same algebraic and logic properties so far obtained only for less expressive language families."

Pentus (2010) gave a polynomial-time algorithm for determ- ining provability of bounded depth formulas in the Lambek calculus with empty antecedents allowed. Pentus' algorithm is based on tabularisation of proof nets. Lambek calculus with brackets is a conservative extension of Lambek calculus with bracket modalities, suitable for the modeling of syntactical domains. In this paper we give an algorithm for provability the Lambek calculus with brackets allowing empty antecedents. Our algorithm runs in polynomial time when both the formula depth and the bracket nesting depth are bounded. It combines a Pentus-style tabularisation of proof nets with an automata-theoretic treatment of bracketing."
2017-04-30 18:20:19+00:00,2017-08-05 14:17:28+00:00,"We study two-player inclusion games played over word-generating higher-order recursion schemes. While inclusion checks are known to capture verification problems, two-player games generalize this relationship to program synthesis. In such games, non-terminals of the grammar are controlled by opposing players. The goal of the existential player is to avoid producing a word that lies outside of a regular language of safe words.   We contribute a new domain that provides a representation of the winning region of such games. Our domain is based on (functions over) potentially infinite Boolean formulas with words as atomic propositions. We develop an abstract interpretation framework that we instantiate to abstract this domain into a domain where the propositions are replaced by states of a finite automaton. This second domain is therefore finite and we obtain, via standard fixed-point techniques, a direct algorithm for the analysis of two-player inclusion games. We show, via a second instantiation of the framework, that our finite domain can be optimized, leading to a (k+1)EXP algorithm for order-k recursion schemes. We give a matching lower bound, showing that our approach is optimal. Since our approach is based on standard Kleene iteration, existing techniques and tools for fixed-point computations can be applied."

We answer this surprisingly non-trivial question by presenting a very general framework that allows to remove delay: finite-state strategies exist for all winning conditions where the resulting delay-free game admits a finite-state strategy. The framework is applicable to games whose winning condition is recognized by an automaton with an acceptance condition that satisfies a certain aggregation property. Our framework also yields upper bounds on the complexity of determining the winner of such delay games and upper bounds on the necessary lookahead to win the game. In particular, we cover all previous results of that kind as special cases of our uniform approach."

In the first part we develop two linear-time algorithms for regular expression based parsing with Perl-style greedy disambiguation. The first algorithm operates in two passes in a semi-streaming fashion, using a constant amount of working memory and an auxiliary tape storage which is written in the first pass and consumed by the second. The second algorithm is a single-pass and optimally streaming algorithm which outputs as much of the parse tree as is semantically possible based on the input prefix read so far, and resorts to buffering as many symbols as is required to resolve the next choice. Optimality is obtained by performing a PSPACE-complete pre-analysis on the regular expression.   In the second part we present Kleenex, a language for expressing high-performance streaming string processing programs as regular grammars with embedded semantic actions, and its compilation to streaming string transducers with worst-case linear-time performance. Its underlying theory is based on transducer decomposition into oracle and action machines, and a finite-state specialization of the streaming parsing algorithm presented in the first part. In the second part we also develop a new linear-time streaming parsing algorithm for parsing expression grammars (PEG) which generalizes the regular grammars of Kleenex. The algorithm is based on a bottom-up tabulation algorithm reformulated using least fixed points and evaluated using an instance of the chaotic iteration scheme by Cousot and Cousot."
2017-04-27 21:29:44+00:00,2017-04-27 21:29:44+00:00,We investigate the Busy Beaver Game introduced by Rado (1962) generalized to non-binary alphabets. Harland (2016) conjectured that activity (number of steps) and productivity (number of non-blank symbols) of candidate machines grow as the alphabet size increases. We prove this conjecture for any alphabet size under the condition that the number of states is sufficiently large. For the measure activity we show that increasing the alphabet size from two to three allows an increase. By a classical construction it is even possible to obtain a two-state machine increasing activity and productivity of any machine if we allow an alphabet size depending on the number of states of the original machine. We also show that an increase of the alphabet by a factor of three admits an increase of activity.

We study three natural problems concerning words giving certain preimages. The first problem is whether, for a given subset, there exists a word \emph{extending} the subset (giving a larger preimage). The second problem is whether there exists a \emph{totally extending} word (giving the whole set of states as a preimage)---equivalently, whether there exists an \emph{avoiding} word for the complementary subset. The third problem is whether there exists a \emph{resizing} word. We also consider variants where the length of the word is upper bounded, where the size of the given subset is restricted, and where the automaton is strongly connected, synchronizing, or binary. We conclude with a summary of the complexities in all combinations of the cases."

The size of the automaton model learned is a bottleneck for scalability, and hence optimizations that enable learning of compact representations are important. This paper exploits monads, both as a mathematical structure and a programming construct, to design, prove correct, and implement a wide class of such optimizations. The former perspective on monads allows us to develop a new algorithm and accompanying correctness proofs, building upon a general framework for automata learning based on category theory. The new algorithm is parametric on a monad, which provides a rich algebraic structure to capture non-determinism and other side-effects. We show that our approach allows us to uniformly capture existing algorithms, develop new ones, and add optimizations. The latter perspective allows us to effortlessly translate the theory into practice: we provide a Haskell library implementing our general framework, and we show experimental results for two specific instances: non-deterministic and weighted automata."

The expressivity of partially ordered NFAs (poNFAs) can be characterized by the Straubing-Th\'erien hierarchy. Level 3/2 is recognized by poNFAs, level 1 by confluent, self-loop deterministic poNFAs as well as by confluent poDFAs, and level 1/2 by saturated poNFAs. We study the universality problem for confluent, self-loop deterministic poNFAs. It asks whether an automaton accepts all words over its alphabet. Universality for both NFAs and poNFAs is a PSpace-complete problem. For confluent, self-loop deterministic poNFAs, the complexity drops to coNP-complete if the alphabet is fixed but is open if the alphabet may grow. We solve this problem by showing that it is PSpace-complete if the alphabet may grow polynomially. Consequently, our result provides a lower-bound complexity for some other problems, including inclusion, equivalence, and $k$-piecewise testability. Since universality for saturated poNFAs is easy, confluent, self-loop deterministic poNFAs are the simplest and natural kind of NFAs characterizing a well-known class of languages, for which deciding universality is as difficult as for general NFAs."

The membership problem for this level is decidable and testing if the language of a DFA is piecewise testable is NL-complete. The question has not yet been addressed for NFAs. We fill in this gap by showing that it is PSpace-complete. The main result is then the lower-bound complexity of separability of regular languages by piecewise testable languages. Two regular languages are separable by a piecewise testable language if the piecewise testable language includes one of them and is disjoint from the other. For languages represented by NFAs, separability by piecewise testable languages is known to be decidable in PTime. We show that it is PTime-hard and that it remains PTime-hard even for minimal DFAs."

As with previous extensions of Kleene Algebra, characterizing the free model is crucial in order to develop the foundations of the theory and potential applications. For CKA, this has been an open question for a few years and this paper makes an important step towards an answer. We present a new automaton model and a Kleene-like theorem that relates a relaxed version of CKA to series-parallel pomset languages, which are a natural candidate for the free model. There are two substantial differences with previous work: from expressions to automata, we use Brzozowski derivatives, which enable a direct construction of the automaton; from automata to expressions, we provide a syntactic characterization of the automata that denote valid CKA behaviours."

Given a specification language, the problem is to produce an improviser, a probabilistic algorithm that randomly generates words in the language, subject to two additional constraints: the satisfaction of a quantitative soft constraint, and the exhibition of a specified amount of randomness. Control improvisation has many applications, including for example systematically generating random test vectors satisfying format constraints or preconditions while being similar to a library of seed inputs. Other applications include robotic surveillance, machine improvisation of music, and randomized variants of the supervisory control problem. We describe a general framework for solving the control improvisation problem, and use it to give efficient algorithms for several practical classes of instances with finite automaton and context-free grammar specifications. We also provide a detailed complexity analysis, establishing #P-hardness of the problem in many other cases. For these intractable cases, we show how symbolic techniques based on Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solvers can be used to find approximate solutions. Finally, we discuss an extension of control improvisation to multiple soft constraints that is useful in some applications."

We introduce a simple category-theoretic formalism that provides an appropriately abstract foundation for studying automata learning. Furthermore, our framework establishes formal relations between algorithms for learning, testing, and minimization.

RA-Q is an extension of the well-known register automata (RA) over infinite alphabets, which are finite automata equipped with a finite number of registers/variables for storing values. Like in the standard RA, the RA-Q model allows both equality and ordering tests between values. It, moreover, allows to perform linear arithmetic between certain variables. The model is quite expressive: in addition to the standard RA, it also generalizes other well-known models such as affine programs and arithmetic circuits.   The main feature of RA-Q is that despite the use of linear arithmetic, the so-called invariant problem---a generalization of the standard non-emptiness problem---is decidable. We also investigate other natural decision problems, namely, commutativity, equivalence, and reachability. For deterministic RA-Q, commutativity and equivalence are polynomial-time inter-reducible with the invariant problem."

It was shown that DSA-languages look similar to DCFL due to their closure properties and NSA-languages look similar to CFL due to their undecidability properties.   In this paper we show that this similarity is natural: we prove that languages recognizable by NSA form a rational cone, so as CFL.   The main topic of this paper is computational complexity: we prove that   - languages recognizable by DSA belong to P and there are P-complete languages among them;   - languages recognizable by NSA are in NP and there are NP-complete languages among them;   - the word membership problem is P-complete for DSA without epsilon-loops and PSPACE-complete for general DSA;   - the emptiness problem is in PSPACE for NSA and, moreover, it is PSPACE-complete for DSA."

However, its comprehensiveness makes the planning and control in POMDP difficult. Traditional POMDP planning problems target to find the optimal policy to maximize the expectation of accumulated rewards. But for safety critical applications, guarantees of system performance described by formal specifications are desired, which motivates us to consider formal methods to synthesize supervisor for POMDP. With system specifications given by Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL), we propose a supervisory control framework with a type of deterministic finite automata (DFA), za-DFA, as the controller form. While the existing work mainly relies on optimization techniques to learn fixed-size finite state controllers (FSCs), we develop an $L^*$ learning based algorithm to determine both space and transitions of za-DFA. Membership queries and different oracles for conjectures are defined. The learning algorithm is sound and complete. An example is given in detailed steps to illustrate the supervisor synthesis algorithm."
2017-03-23 11:24:05+00:00,2017-05-26 13:06:03+00:00,"Software libraries implement APIs that deliver reusable functionalities. To correctly use these functionalities, software applications must satisfy certain correctness policies, for instance policies about the order some API methods can be invoked and about the values that can be used for the parameters. If these policies are violated, applications may produce misbehaviors and failures at runtime. Although this problem is general, applications that incorrectly use API methods are more frequent in certain contexts. For instance, Android provides a rich and rapidly evolving set of APIs that might be used incorrectly by app developers who often implement and publish faulty apps in the marketplaces. To mitigate this problem, we introduce the novel notion of proactive library, which augments classic libraries with the capability of proactively detecting and healing misuses at run- time. Proactive libraries blend libraries with multiple proactive modules that collect data, check the correctness policies of the libraries, and heal executions as soon as the violation of a correctness policy is detected. The proactive modules can be activated or deactivated at runtime by the users and can be implemented without requiring any change to the original library and any knowledge about the applications that may use the library. We evaluated proactive libraries in the context of the Android ecosystem. Results show that proactive libraries can automati- cally overcome several problems related to bad resource usage at the cost of a small overhead."

Until now a full analysis of all DFAs reaching this bound was only given for $n \leq 4$, and with bounds on the number of symbols for $n \leq 10$. Here we give the full analysis for $n \leq 6$, without bounds on the number of symbols.   For PFAs the bound is much higher. For $n \leq 6$ we do a similar analysis as for DFAs and find the maximal shortest synchronizing word lengths, exceeding $(n-1)^2$ for $n =4,5,6$. For arbitrary n we give a construction of a PFA on three symbols with exponential shortest synchronizing word length, giving significantly better bounds than earlier exponential constructions.

The Contract pattern allows the engineer to specify constrained behaviours to which constituent systems are required to conform in order to be a part of the SoS. However, the Contract pattern faces some limitations in terms of its accessibility and suitability for verifying contract compatibility. To address these deficiencies, we propose the enrichment of the Contract pattern, which hitherto has been defined using SysML and the COMPASS Modelling Language (CML), by utilising SysML and Object Constraint Language (OCL). In addition, we examine the potential of interface automata, a notation for improving loose coupling between interfaces of constituent systems defined according to the contract, as a means of enabling the verification of contract compatibility.

Alternatively, they can be seen as a model of concurrency with synchronized choice as communication primitive. Well-designed negotiations must be sound, meaning that, whatever its current state, the negotiation can still be completed. In earlier work, Esparza and Desel have shown that deciding soundness of a negotiation is Pspace-complete, and in Ptime if the negotiation is deterministic. They have also extended their polynomial soundness algorithm to an intermediate class of acyclic, non-deterministic negotiations. However, they did not analyze the runtime of the extended algorithm, and also left open the complexity of the soundness problem for the intermediate class. In the first part of this paper we revisit the soundness problem for deterministic negotiations, and show that it is Nlogspace-complete, improving on the earlier algorithm, which requires linear space. In the second part we answer the question left open by Esparza and Desel. We prove that the soundness problem can be solved in polynomial time for acyclic, weakly non- deterministic negotiations, a more general class than the one considered by them. In the third and final part, we show that the techniques developed in the first two parts of the paper can be applied to analysis problems other than soundness, including the problem of detecting race conditions, and several classical static analysis problems. More specifically, we show that, while these problems are intractable for arbitrary acyclic deterministic negotiations, they become tractable in the sound case.

State complexity of a language is the number of states of the minimal DFA for the language. For a language of state complexity $n$, we show that the upper-bound state complexity on the infimal prefix-closed and observable superlanguage is $2^n + 1$ and that this bound is asymptotically tight. It proves that there is no algorithm computing a DFA of the infimal prefix-closed and observable superlanguage in polynomial time.

We study the computation of the supremal prefix-closed sublanguage and show that there is no polynomial-time algorithm that computes an NFA of the supremal prefix-closed sublanguage of a language given as an NFA even if the language is unary."

The workshop emphasises modelling over verification. It aims at discussing the lessons learned from making formal methods for the verification and analysis of realistic systems. Examples are:   (1) Which formalism is chosen, and why?   (2) Which abstractions have to be made and why?   (3) How are important characteristics of the system modelled?   (4) Were there any complications while modelling the system?   (5) Which measures were taken to guarantee the accuracy of the model?   We invited papers that present full models of real systems, which may lay the basis for future comparison and analysis. An aim of the workshop is to present different modelling approaches and discuss pros and cons for each of them. Alternative formal descriptions of the systems presented at this workshop are encouraged, which should foster the development of improved specification formalisms."

Green's relations can be defined by reachability in the (right/left/two-sided) Cayley graph. The equivalence classes then correspond to the strongly connected components. It is not difficult to show that, in the worst case, the number of equivalence classes is in the same order of magnitude as the number of elements. Another important parameter is the maximal length of a chain of components. Our main contribution is an exponential lower bound for this parameter. There is a simple construction for an arbitrary set of generators. However, the proof for constant alphabet is rather involved. Our results also apply to automata and their syntactic semigroups."

Moreover, the only way to (with certainty) unlock using four operations is to do them in the sequence 0011, i.e., $0^n1^n$ where $n=2$. In this scenario one might think that the lock needs to be in certain further states after each operation, so that there is some memory of what has been done so far. Here we show that this memory can be entirely encoded in superpositions of the two basic states ""locked"" and ""unlocked"", where, as dictated by quantum mechanics, the operations are given by unitary matrices. Moreover, we show using the Jordan--Schur lemma that a similar lock is not possible for $n=60$.   We define the semi-classical quantum automatic complexity $Q_{s}(x)$ of a word $x$ as the infimum in lexicographic order of those pairs of nonnegative integers $(n,q)$ such that there is a subgroup $G$ of the projective unitary group PU$(n)$ with $|G|\le q$ and with $U_0,U_1\in G$ such that, in terms of a standard basis $\{e_k\}$ and with $U_z=\prod_k U_{z(k)}$, we have $U_x e_1=e_2$ and $U_y e_1 \ne e_2$ for all $y\ne x$ with $|y|=|x|$. We show that $Q_s$ is unbounded and not constant for strings of a given length. In particular, \[   Q_{s}(0^21^2)\le (2,12) < (3,1) \le Q_{s}(0^{60}1^{60}) \] and $Q_s(0^{120})\le (2,121)$."

We propose a customized modal logic that expresses these numeric boundaries for transition weights by means of particular modalities. We prove that our logic is invariant under the proposed notion of bisimulation. We show that the logic enjoys the finite model property and we identify a complete axiomatization for the logic.

In this tutorial, we will illustrate the study of such questions over finite word models, first with logics for Unambiguous Starfree Regular Languages (UL), originally defined by Schutzenberger, and then for extensions with constraints, which appear in interval logics. We present Deterministic temporal logics, with diverse sets of modalities, which also characterize UL. The tools and techniques used go under the name of ""Turtle Programs"" or ""Rankers"". These are simple kinds of automata. We use properties such as Ranker Directionality and Ranker Convexity to show that all these logics have NP satisfiability. A recursive extension of some of these modalities gives us the full power of first-order logic over finite linear orders. We also discuss Interval Constraint modalities extending Deterministic temporal logics, with intermediate expressiveness. These allow counting or simple algebraic operations on paths. The complexity of these extended logics is PSpace, as of full temporal logic (and ExpSpace when using binary notation)."

The output is another combinatorial filter F' with at most k states, such that the difference in behavior between F and F' is minimal. We present two metrics for measuring the distance between pairs of filters, describe dynamic programming algorithms for computing these distances, and show that improper filter reduction is NP-hard under these metrics.

Here many models of language acceptors with various data structures are examined, along with a study of their store languages. For each model, an attempt is made to find the simplest model that accepts their store languages. Some connections between store languages of one-way and two-way machines generally are demonstrated, as with connections between nondeterministic and deterministic machines. A nice application of these store language results is also presented, showing a general technique for proving families accepted by many deterministic models are closed under right quotient with regular languages, resolving some open questions (and significantly simplifying proofs for others that are known) in the literature. Lower bounds on the space complexity for recognizing store languages for the languages to be non-regular are obtained."

In this paper, we show that this small model property does not hold neither for mailbox communications, nor for peer-to-peer communications, therefore the decidability of synchronizability becomes an open question. We close this question for peer-to-peer communications, and we show that synchronizability is actually undecidable. We show that synchronizability is decidable if the topology of communications is an oriented ring. We also show that, in this case, synchronizability implies the absence of unspecified receptions and orphan messages, and the channel-recognizability of the reachability set."

However, the best known algorithms for composing two-way transducers cause a double exponential blow-up in the size of the inputs. In this paper, we introduce a class of transducers for which the composition has polynomial complexity. It is the class of reversible transducers, for which the computation steps can be reversed deterministically. While in the one-way setting this class is not very expressive, we prove that any two-way transducer can be made reversible through a single exponential blow-up. As a consequence, we prove that the composition of two-way transducers can be done with a single exponential blow-up in the number of states. A uniformization of a relation is a function with the same domain and which is included in the original relation. Our main result actually states that we can uniformize any non-deterministic two-way transducer by a reversible transducer with a single exponential blow-up, improving the known result by de Souza which has a quadruple exponential complexity. As a side result, our construction also gives a quadratic transformation from copyless streaming string transducers to two-way transducers, improving the exponential previous bound."

Second, we show that each nonempty language $L$ has a representative subset of at most three elements which behaves like $L$ w.r.t. the longest common prefix as well as w.r.t. longest common prefixes of $L$ after unions or concatenations with arbitrary other languages.

This setting raises new challenges in comparison to quantitative objectives, as one cannot easily mix different strategies without endangering the functional properties of the system.

To obtain the new upper bound we utilize avoiding words. A word is avoiding for a state $q$ if after reading the word the automaton cannot be in $q$. We obtain upper bounds on the length of the shortest avoiding words, and using the approach of Trahtman from 2011 combined with the well known Frankl theorem from 1982, we improve the general upper bound on the length of the shortest reset words.

We then turn to the study of the quotient/state complexity of common operations on regular languages: reversal, (Kleene) star, product (concatenation) and boolean operations. We examine relations among these complexity measures. We discuss several subclasses of regular languages defined by convexity. In many, but not all, cases there exist ""most complex"" languages, languages satisfying all these complexity measures."

In another area of research, quantitative models of systems are also greatly in demand. In this paper, we lay the foundation to marry these two research fields. We introduce weighted operator precedence automata and show how they are both strict extensions of OPA and weighted visibly pushdown automata. We prove a Nivat-like result which shows that quantitative OPL can be described by unweighted OPA and very particular weighted OPA. In a B\""uchi-like theorem, we show that weighted OPA are expressively equivalent to a weighted MSO-logic for OPL."

For the class of regular languages we proved a space trichotomy theorem: for every regular language the optimal space bound is either constant, logarithmic or linear. In this paper we continue this line of research: We present natural characterizations for the constant and logarithmic space classes and establish tight relationships to the concept of language growth. We also analyze the space complexity with respect to automata size and prove almost matching lower and upper bounds. Finally, we consider the decision problem whether a language given by a DFA/NFA admits a sliding window algorithm using logarithmic/constant space."

In the case of an NFA, we show that this problem is NEXPTIME-complete, and the smallest such $\ell$ can be doubly exponential in the number of states. This particular case was formulated as an open problem in 2009, and our solution uses a novel and involved construction. In the case of a PDA, we show that it is recursively unsolvable, while the smallest such $\ell$ is not bounded by any computable function of the number of states. In the case of a DFA, we show that the problem is NP-complete, and $e^{\sqrt{n \log n} (1+o(1))}$ is an asymptotically tight upper bound for the smallest such $\ell$, where $n$ is the number of states. Finally, we prove that in all these cases, the problem becomes computationally easier when the length $\ell$ is also given in binary in the input: it is polynomially solvable for a DFA, PSPACE-complete for an NFA, and co-NEXPTIME-complete for a PDA."

Finite semigroups $S$ that generate join irreducible pseudovarieties are characterized as follows: whenever $S$ divides a direct product $A \times B$ of finite semigroups, then $S$ divides either $A^n$ or $B^n$ for some $n \geq 1$. We present a new operator ${ \mathbf{V} \mapsto \mathbf{V}^\mathsf{bar} }$ that preserves the property of join irreducibility, as does the dual operator, and show that iteration of these operators on any nontrivial join irreducible pseudovariety leads to an infinite hierarchy of join irreducible pseudovarieties. We also describe all join irreducible pseudovarieties generated by a semigroup of order up to five. It turns out that there are $30$ such pseudovarieties, and there is a relatively easy way to remember them. In addition, we survey most results known about join irreducible pseudovarieties to date and generalize a number of results in Sec. 7.3 of The $q$-theory of Finite Semigroups, Springer Monographs in Mathematics (Springer, Berlin, 2009)."

It is known that eventually periodic sets are $b$-recognisable in every base $b$, and Cobham's theorem implies the converse: no other set is $b$-recognisable in every base $b$.   We are interested in deciding whether a $b$-recognisable set of integers (given as a finite automaton) is eventually periodic. Honkala showed that this problem decidable in 1986 and recent developments give efficient decision algorithms. However, they only work when the integers are written with the least significant digit first.   In this work, we consider the natural order of digits (Most Significant Digit First) and give a quasi-linear algorithm to solve the problem in this case."

Due to the dependency of Parikh matrices on the ordering of the alphabet, strong M-equivalence was proposed as an order-independent alternative to M-equivalence in studying words possessing the same Parikh matrix. This paper introduces and studies the notions of strong 2.t and strong 3.t transformations in determining when two ternary words are strongly M-equivalent. The irreducibility of strong 2.t transformations are then scrutinized, exemplified by a structural characterization of irreducible strong 2.2 transformations. The common limitation of these transformations in characterizing strong M-equivalence is then addressed."

Thanks to this $\mathsf{NECC}$ graph, we bound $\kappa$ in the worst case between $n/2$ and $2n/3+2$ ($n$ being the size of the BAN simulated) and we conjecture that this number equals $n/2$. We support this conjecture with two results: the clique number of a $\mathsf{NECC}$ graph is always less than or equal to $n/2$ and, for the subclass of bijective BANs, $\kappa$ is always less than or equal to $n/2+1$."

For example, Anisimov showed that a group is finite if and only if its word problem is a regular language, and Muller and Schupp showed that a group is virtually-free if and only if its word problem is a context-free language. Above this, not much was known, until Salvati showed recently that the word problem of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ is a multiple context-free language, giving first such example.

We consider algebras for a monad T on a category D and we study (pseudo)varieties of T-algebras. Pseudovarieties of algebras are also known in the literature as varieties of finite algebras. Two well-known theorems that characterize varieties and pseudovarieties of algebras play an important role here: Birkhoff's theorem and Birkhoff's theorem for finite algebras, the latter also known as Reiterman's theorem. We prove, under mild assumptions, a categorical version of Birkhoff's theorem for (finite) algebras to establish a one-to-one correspondence between (pseudo)varieties of T-algebras and (pseudo)equational T-theories. Now, if C is a category that is dual to D and B is the comonad on C that is the dual of T, we get a one-to-one correspondence between (pseudo)equational T-theories and their dual, (pseudo)coequational B-theories. Particular instances of (pseudo)coequational B-theories have been already studied in language theory under the name of ""varieties of languages"" to establish Eilenberg-type correspondences. All in all, we get a one-to-one correspondence between (pseudo)varieties of T-algebras and (pseudo)coequational B-theories, which will be shown to be exactly the nature of Eilenberg-type correspondences."

First, a one-dimensional cellular automaton is used for expressing some dynamic changes in the structure of a computing unit, a sequential automaton is employed to describe some state transitions, a hierarchical automaton is employed to express the different granularities of some computing units, and a probabilistic automaton is used to depict some random changes of a computing unit. Second, the new automaton is obtained by combining the various types of automata mentioned above in the certain logical relationship. To the best of our knowledge, the new automaton model is the first automaton which can portray the operation semantics for a mimic computing system, and it can directly describe some behaviors of a mimic computer."

To that end, we first introduce a new notion of context-bounding that is suitable for reasoning about computations under POWER, which generalizes the one defined by Atig et al. in 2011 for the TSO memory model. Then, we provide a polynomial size reduction of the context-bounded state reachability problem under POWER to the same problem under SC: Given an input concurrent program P, our method produces a concurrent program P' such that, for a fixed number of context switches, running P' under SC yields the same set of reachable states as running P under POWER. The generated program P' contains the same number of processes as P, and operates on the same data domain. By leveraging the standard model checker CBMC, we have implemented a prototype tool and applied it on a set of benchmarks, showing the feasibility of our approach."

We prove that a permutation DFA is uniformly minimal if and only if its transition monoid is a primitive group. We use this to study boolean operations on group languages, which are recognized by direct products of permutation DFAs. A direct product cannot be uniformly minimal, except in the trivial case where one of the DFAs in the product is a one-state DFA. However, non-trivial direct products can satisfy a weaker condition we call uniform boolean minimality, where only final state sets used to recognize boolean operations are considered. We give sufficient conditions for a direct product of two DFAs to be uniformly boolean minimal, which in turn gives sufficient conditions for pairs of group languages to have maximal state complexity under all binary boolean operations (""maximal boolean complexity""). In the case of permutation DFAs with one final state, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for pairs of group languages to have maximal boolean complexity. Our results demonstrate a connection between primitive groups and automata with strong minimality properties."

The exact computational complexity of this problem remains unknown, with the best lower and upper bounds being, respectively, NP and PSPACE. Recently, the novel technique of recompression was applied to this problem, simplifying the known proofs and lowering the space complexity to (nondeterministic) O(n log n). In this paper we show that satisfiability of word equations is in nondeterministic linear space, thus the language of satisfiable word equations is context-sensitive, and by the famous Immerman-Szelepcsenyi theorem: the language of unsatisfiable word equations is also context-sensitive. We use the known recompression-based algorithm and additionally employ Huffman coding for letters. The proof, however, uses analysis of how the fragments of the equation depend on each other as well as a new strategy for nondeterministic choices of the algorithm, which uses several new ideas to limit the space occupied by the letters."

The normalization preserves the recognized weighted tree language even for nondeterministic wta, but it is most useful for bottom-up deterministic wta, where it can be used for minimization and equivalence testing. In both applications a careful selection of the weights to be redistributed followed by normalization allows a reduction of the general problem to the corresponding problem for bottom-up deterministic unweighted tree automata. This approach was already successfully used by Mohri and Eisner for the minimization of deterministic weighted string automata. Moreover, the new equivalence test for two wta $M$ and $M'$ runs in time $\mathcal O((\lvert M \rvert + \lvert M'\rvert) \cdot \log {(\lvert Q\rvert + \lvert Q'\rvert)})$, where $Q$ and $Q'$ are the states of $M$ and $M'$, respectively, which improves the previously best run-time $\mathcal O(\lvert M \rvert \cdot \lvert M'\rvert)$."

The exploration of large chemical reaction networks is a central aspect in this endeavour. While quantum chemical methods can accurately predict the structures and reactivities of small molecules, they are not efficient enough to cope with large-scale reaction systems. The formalization of chemical reactions as graph grammars provides a generative system, well grounded in category theory, at the right level of abstraction for the analysis of large and complex reaction networks. An extension of the basic formalism into the realm of integer hyperflows allows for the identification of complex reaction patterns, such as auto-catalysis, in large reaction networks using optimization techniques."

Still the statement and the proof of this result as given by Becher and Heiber (2013) in terms of ""lossless finite-state compressors"" do not follow the standard scheme of Kolmogorov complexity definition (an automaton is used for compression, not decompression). We modify this approach to make it more similar to the traditional Kolmogorov complexity theory (and simpler) by explicitly defining the notion of automatic Kolmogorov complexity and using its simple properties.   Using this characterization and a sufficient condition for normality in terms of Kolmogorov complexity derived from it, we provide easy proofs for classical results about normal sequences (Champernown, Wall, Piatetski-Shapiro, Besicovitch, Copeland, Erdos et al.)   Then we extend this approach to finite state dimension. We show that the block entropy definition of the finite state dimension remains the same if non-aligned blocks are used. Then we provide equivalent definitions in terms of automatic complexity, superadditive bounds for Kolmogorov complexity, calibrated superadditive functions and finite state a priori probability and use them to give simple proofs for known results about finite state dimension, and for Agafonov's result saying that normality is preserved by automatic selection rules as well as the results of Schnorr and Stimm that relate normality to finite state martingales.

Known decision procedures for this model are based on complex encodings of store buffers as lossy channels. These procedures assume that the number of processes is fixed. However, it is important in general to prove the correctness of a system/algorithm in a parametric way with an arbitrarily large number of processes.   In this paper, we introduce an alternative (yet equivalent) semantics to the classical one for the TSO semantics that is more amenable to efficient algorithmic verification and for the extension to parametric verification. For that, we adopt a dual view where load buffers are used instead of store buffers. The flow of information is now from the memory to load buffers. We show that this new semantics allows (1) to simplify drastically the safety analysis under TSO, (2) to obtain a spectacular gain in efficiency and scalability compared to existing procedures, and (3) to extend easily the decision procedure to the parametric case, which allows obtaining a new decidability result, and more importantly, a verification algorithm that is more general and more efficient in practice than the one for bounded instances."

We prove that when at most two variables are not alternation bounded, the $\Sigma_1$ fragment is decidable, and that it becomes undecidable when three variables are not alternation bounded. Regarding higher quantifier alternation depths, we prove that the $\Sigma_2$ fragment is undecidable already for one variable without alternation bound and that when all variables are alternation bounded, the entire first-order theory is decidable."

Roughly speaking, one may distinguish two kinds of simultaneous or parallel rewrite relations over complex structures such as graphs: (i) those which transform disjoint subgraphs in parallel and hence can be simulated by successive mere sequential and local transformations and (ii) those which transform overlapping subgraphs simultaneously. In the latter situations, parallel transformations cannot be simulated in general by means of successive local rewrite steps. We investigate this last problem in the framework of overlapping graph transformation systems. As parallel transformation of a graph does not produce a graph in general, we propose first some sufficient conditions that ensure the closure of graphs by parallel rewrite relations. Then we mainly introduce and discuss two parallel rewrite relations over graphs. One relation is functional and thus deterministic, the other one is not functional for which we propose sufficient conditions which ensure its confluence."

It originates from the classical approach, which first builds an automaton accepting all models of a formula and then tests whether its language is empty. The main novelty is to test the emptiness on the fly, while constructing a symbolic, term-based representation of the automaton, and prune the constructed state space from parts irrelevant to the test. The pruning is done by a generalization of two techniques used in antichain-based language inclusion and universality checking of finite automata: subsumption and early termination. The richer structure of the WS1S decision problem allows us, however, to elaborate on these techniques in novel ways. Our experiments show that the proposed approach can in many cases significantly outperform the classical decision procedure (implemented in the MONA tool) as well as recently proposed alternatives."

Our approach is presented in the particular case of the language finiteness problem for nondeterministic higher-order recursion schemes (HORSes): given a nondeterministic HORS, decide whether the set of all finite trees generated by this HORS is finite.

We focus on multi-sequential WA that are defined as finite unions of sequential WA. The problem we address is to minimize the size of this union. We call this minimum the degree of sequentiality of (the relation realized by) the WA. For a given positive integer k, we provide multiple characterizations of relations realized by a union of k sequential WA over an infinitary finitely generated group: a Lipschitz-like machine independent property, a pattern on the automaton (a new twinning property) and a subclass of cost register automata. When possible, we effectively translate a WA into an equivalent union of k sequential WA. We also provide a decision procedure for our twinning property for commutative computable groups thus allowing to compute the degree of sequentiality. Last, we show that these results also hold for word transducers and that the associated decision problem is Pspace-complete."

A domain-specific form of such synthesis has been recently deployed in a widely used spreadsheet software product. In this paper we contribute to foundations of such techniques and present a complete algorithm for synthesis of a class of recursive functions defined by structural recursion over a given algebraic data type definition. The functions we consider map an algebraic data type to a string; they are useful for, e.g., pretty printing and serialization of programs and data. We formalize our problem as learning deterministic sequential top-down tree-to-string transducers with a single state.   The first problem we consider is learning a tree-to-string transducer from any set of input/output examples provided by the user. We show that this problem is NP-complete in general, but can be solved in polynomial time under a (practically useful) closure condition that each subtree of a tree in the input/output example set is also part of the input/output examples.   Because coming up with relevant input/output examples may be difficult for the user while creating hard constraint problems for the synthesizer, we also study a more automated active learning scenario in which the algorithm chooses the inputs for which the user provides the outputs. Our algorithm asks a worst-case linear number of queries as a function of the size of the algebraic data type definition to determine a unique transducer."

A prominent algorithmic complexity attack is regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS), in which the attacker exploits a vulnerable regular expression by providing a carefully-crafted input string that triggers worst-case behavior of the matching algorithm. This paper proposes a technique for automatically finding ReDoS vulnerabilities in programs. Specifically, our approach automatically identifies vulnerable regular expressions in the program and determines whether an ""evil"" input string can be matched against a vulnerable regular expression. We have implemented our proposed approach in a tool called REXPLOITER and found 41 exploitable security vulnerabilities in Java web applications."

Eom, Han and Jir\'askov\'a derived upper bounds on the state complexity of boolean operations and Kleene star, and proved that these bounds are tight using two different binary witnesses. They derived upper bounds for concatenation and reversal using three different ternary witnesses. These five witnesses use a total of six different transformations. We show that for each $n\ge 4$ there exists a ternary witness of state complexity $n$ that meets the bound for reversal and that at least three letters are needed to meet this bound. Moreover, the restrictions of this witness to binary alphabets meet the bounds for product, star, and boolean operations. We also derive tight upper bounds on the state complexity of binary operations that take arguments with different alphabets. We prove that the maximal syntactic semigroup of a non-returning language has $(n-1)^n$ elements and requires at least $\binom{n}{2}$ generators. We find the maximal state complexities of atoms of non-returning languages. Finally, we show that there exists a most complex non-returning language that meets the bounds for all these complexity measures."

We show that there exist a single ternary universal (stream of) bifix-free languages that meet all the bounds for the state complexity basic operations (Boolean operations, product, star, and reversal). This is in contrast with suffix-free languages, where it is known that there does not exist such a stream. Then we present a stream of bifix-free languages that is most complex in terms of all basic operations, syntactic complexity, and the number of atoms and their complexities, which requires a superexponential alphabet.   We also complete the previous results by characterizing state complexity of product, star, and reversal, and establishing tight upper bounds for atom complexities of bifix-free languages. We show that to meet the bound for reversal we require at least 3 letters and to meet the bound for atom complexities $n+1$ letters are sufficient and necessary. For the cases of product, star, and reversal we show that there are no gaps (magic numbers) in the interval of possible state complexities of the languages resulted from an operation; in particular, the state complexity of the product $L_m L_n$ is always $m+n-2$, while of the star is either $n-1$ or $n-2$."
2017-01-13 13:57:07+00:00,2018-05-30 11:35:47+00:00,"We introduce a logic, called LT, to express properties of transductions, i.e. binary relations from input to output (finite) words. In LT, the input/output dependencies are modelled via an origin function which associates to any position of the output word, the input position from which it originates. LT is well-suited to express relations (which are not necessarily functional), and can express all regular functional transductions, i.e. transductions definable for instance by deterministic two-way transducers. Despite its high expressive power, LT has decidable satisfiability and equivalence problems, with tight non-elementary and elementary complexities, depending on specific representation of LT-formulas. Our main contribution is a synthesis result: from any transduction R defined in LT , it is possible to synthesise a regular functional transduction f such that for all input words u in the domain of R, f is defined and (u,f(u)) belongs to R. As a consequence, we obtain that any functional transduction is regular iff it is LT-definable. We also investigate the algorithmic and expressiveness properties of several extensions of LT, and explicit a correspondence between transductions and data words. As a side-result, we obtain a new decidable logic for data words."

In this paper we prove that the set of all solutions of a twisted word equation is an EDT0L language whose specification can be computed in $\mathsf{PSPACE}$. Within the same complexity bound we can decide whether the solution set is empty, finite, or infinite.   In the second part of the paper we apply the results for twisted equations to obtain in $\mathsf{PSPACE}$ an EDT0L description of the solution set of equations with rational constraints for finitely generated virtually free groups in standard normal forms with respect to a natural set of generators. If the rational constraints are given by a homomorphism into a fixed (or ""small enough"") finite monoid, then our algorithms can be implemented in $\mathsf{NSPACE}(n^2\log n)$, that is, in quasi-quadratic nondeterministic space.   Our results generalize the work by Lohrey and S\'enizergues (ICALP 2006) and Dahmani and Guirardel (J. of Topology 2010) with respect to both complexity and expressive power.

For downward closures, we prove that the size of the minimal automata can be non-primitive recursive. In the case of BPP nets, a well-known subclass of Petri nets, we show that an FSA accepting the downward/upward closure can be constructed in exponential time. Furthermore, we consider the problem of checking whether a simple regular language is included in the downward/upward closure of a Petri net/BPP net language. We show that this problem is EXPSPACE-complete (resp. NP-complete) in the case of Petri nets (resp. BPP nets). Finally, we show that it is decidable whether a Petri net language is upward/downward closed. To this end, we prove that one can decide whether a given regular language is a subset of a Petri net coverability language."

We propose two ways of approaching it by constraining the search space of deterministic WA: k-delay and r-regret. A WA N is k-delay determinizable if there exists a deterministic automaton D that defines the same function as N and for all words {\alpha} in the language of N, the accepting run of D on {\alpha} is always at most k-away from a maximal accepting run of N on {\alpha}. That is, along all prefixes of the same length, the absolute difference between the running sums of weights of the two runs is at most k. A WA N is r-regret determinizable if for all words {\alpha} in its language, its non-determinism can be resolved on the fly to construct a run of N such that the absolute difference between its value and the value assigned to {\alpha} by N is at most r.   We show that a WA is determinizable if and only if it is k-delay determinizable for some k. Hence deciding the existence of some k is as difficult as the general determinization problem. When k and r are given as input, the k-delay and r-regret determinization problems are shown to be EXPtime-complete. We also show that determining whether a WA is r-regret determinizable for some r is in EXPtime."

An element $\tau \in \text{CA}(G;A)$ is von Neumann regular (or simply regular) if there exists $\sigma \in \text{CA}(G;A)$ such that $\tau \circ \sigma \circ \tau = \tau$ and $\sigma \circ \tau \circ \sigma = \sigma$, where $\circ$ is the composition of functions.

We establish that $\text{CA}(G;A)$ is regular if and only if $\vert G \vert = 1$ or $\vert A \vert = 1$, and we characterise all regular elements in $\text{CA}(G;A)$ when $G$ and $A$ are both finite. Furthermore, we study regular linear CA when $A= V$ is a vector space over a field $\mathbb{F}$; in particular, we show that every regular linear CA is invertible when $G$ is torsion-free elementary amenable (e.g. when $G=\mathbb{Z}^d, \ d \in \mathbb{N}$) and $V=\mathbb{F}$, and that every linear CA is regular when $V$ is finite-dimensional and $G$ is locally finite with $\text{Char}(\mathbb{F}) \nmid o(g)$ for all $g \in G$."

In a delay game, one of the players may delay her moves to obtain a lookahead on her opponent's moves. We show that determining the winner of delay games with winning conditions given by parity automata with costs is EXPTIME-complete and that exponential bounded lookahead is both sufficient and in general necessary. Thus, although the parity condition with costs is a quantitative extension of the parity condition, our results show that adding costs does not increase the complexity of delay games with parity conditions.   Furthermore, we study a new phenomenon that appears in quantitative delay games: lookahead can be traded for the quality of winning strategies and vice versa. We determine the extent of this tradeoff. In particular, even the smallest lookahead allows to improve the quality of an optimal strategy from the worst possible value to almost the smallest possible one. Thus, the benefit of introducing lookahead is twofold: not only does it allow the delaying player to win games she would lose without, but lookahead also allows her to improve the quality of her winning strategies in games she wins even without lookahead."

We exhibit results showing that this sequence is deeply related to the combinatorial and periodic structure of a word. In the case of Sturmian words, we show that these are uniquely determined (up to renaming letters) by their oc-sequence. Moreover, we prove that the class of finite Sturmian words is a maximal element with this property in the class of binary factorial languages. We then discuss several aspects of Sturmian words that can be expressed through this sequence. Finally, we provide a linear-time algorithm that computes the oc-sequence of a finite word, and a linear-time algorithm that reconstructs a finite Sturmian word from its oc-sequence."

Connecting subsystems modeled using finite automata into a network allows for more computational power. One such network, called a cellular automaton, consists of an n-dimensional array for n > 1 with a single finite automaton located at each point of the array. One of the oldest problems associated with cellular automata is the firing synchronization problem, originally proposed by John Myhill in 1957. As with any long-standing problem, there are a large number of solutions to the firing synchronization problem. Our goal, and the contribution of this work, is to summarize recent solutions to the problem. We focus primarily on solutions to the original problem, that is, the problem where the network is a one-dimensional array and there is a single initiator located at one of the ends. We summarize both minimal-time and non-minimal-time solutions, with an emphasis on solutions that were published after 1998. We also focus on solutions that minimize the number of states required by the finite automata. In the process we also identify open problems that remain in terms of finding minimal-state solutions to the firing synchronization problem."

A word of length $n$ can contain at most $\Theta(n^2)$ distinct factors, and there exist words of length $n$ containing $\Theta(n^2)$ distinct abelian-square factors, that is, distinct factors that are abelian squares. This motivates us to study infinite words such that the number of distinct abelian-square factors of length $n$ grows quadratically with $n$. More precisely, we say that an infinite word $w$ is {\it abelian-square-rich} if, for every $n$, every factor of $w$ of length $n$ contains, on average, a number of distinct abelian-square factors that is quadratic in $n$; and {\it uniformly abelian-square-rich} if every factor of $w$ contains a number of distinct abelian-square factors that is proportional to the square of its length. Of course, if a word is uniformly abelian-square-rich, then it is abelian-square-rich, but we show that the converse is not true in general. We prove that the Thue-Morse word is uniformly abelian-square-rich and that the function counting the number of distinct abelian-square factors of length $2n$ of the Thue-Morse word is $2$-regular. As for Sturmian words, we prove that a Sturmian word $s_{\alpha}$ of angle $\alpha$ is uniformly abelian-square-rich if and only if the irrational $\alpha$ has bounded partial quotients, that is, if and only if $s_{\alpha}$ has bounded exponent."

In this paper, we look into the question of how suitable FDFAs are for defining omega-regular languages. Specifically, we look into the complexity of performing Boolean operations, such as complementation and intersection, on FDFAs, the complexity of solving decision problems, such as emptiness and language containment, and the succinctness of FDFAs compared to standard deterministic and nondeterministic $\omega$-automata.   We show that FDFAs enjoy the benefits of deterministic automata with respect to Boolean operations and decision problems. Namely, they can all be performed in nondeterministic logarithmic space. We provide polynomial translations of deterministic B\""uchi and co-B\""uchi automata to FDFAs and of FDFAs to nondeterministic B\""uchi automata (NBAs). We show that translation of an NBA to an FDFA may involve an exponential blowup. Last, we show that FDFAs are more succinct than deterministic parity automata (DPAs) in the sense that translating a DPA to an FDFA can always be done with only a polynomial increase, yet the other direction involves an inevitable exponential blowup in the worst case."

The soundness and summarization problems can be solved by means of simple algorithms acting on the state space of the negotiation, which however face the well-known state explosion problem. We study alternative algorithms that avoid the construction of the state space. In particular, we define reduction rules that simplify a negotiation while preserving the sound/non-sound character of the negotiation and its summary. In a first result we show that our rules are complete for the class of weakly deterministic acyclic negotiations, meaning that they reduce all sound negotiations in this class, and only them, to equivalent one-step negotiations. This provides algorithms for both the soundness and summarization problems that avoid the construction of the state space. We then study the class of deterministic negotiations. Our second main result shows that the rules are also complete for this class, even if the negotiation contains cycles. Moreover, we present an algorithm that completely reduces all sound deterministic negotiations, and only them, in polynomial time."

This problem is related to two well-known conjectures formulated by Cerny and Restivo, respectively.

QREs are a flexible formal language for specifying complex numerical queries over data streams, with provable runtime and memory consumption guarantees. The medical-device algorithms of interest include peak detection (where a peak in a cardiac signal indicates a heartbeat) and various discriminators, each of which uses a feature of the cardiac signal to distinguish fatal from non-fatal arrhythmias. Expressing these algorithms' desired output in current temporal logics, and implementing them via monitor synthesis, is cumbersome, error-prone, computationally expensive, and sometimes infeasible.   In contrast, we show that a range of peak detectors (in both the time and wavelet domains) and various discriminators at the heart of today's arrhythmia-detection devices are easily expressible in QREs. The fact that one formalism (QREs) is used to describe the desired end-to-end operation of an arrhythmia detector opens the way to formal analysis and rigorous testing of these detectors' correctness and performance. Such analysis could alleviate the regulatory burden on device developers when modifying their algorithms. The performance of the peak-detection QREs is demonstrated by running them on real patient data, on which they yield results on par with those provided by a cardiologist."

Additionally, we explore how minotaut alone can play an important role when performing hard operations like complementation, allowing to both obtain smaller complement automata and lower computation times. We then show how saturation can extend this contribution even further. We tested our algorithms on a large collection of automata from applications of libvata in shape analysis, and on different classes of randomly generated automata."

In this paper, we use results in automata theory to study two quantities associated with sets of matrices: the joint spectral radius and the ultimate rank. We prove that these two quantities are not computable over the tropical semiring, i.e. there is no algorithm that takes as input a finite set of matrices M and provides as output the joint spectral radius (resp. the ultimate rank) of M. On the other hand, we prove that the joint spectral radius is nevertheless approximable and we exhibit restricted cases in which the joint spectral radius and the ultimate rank are computable. To reach this aim, we study the problem of comparing functions computed by weighted automata over the tropical semiring. This problem is known to be undecidable and we prove that it remains undecidable in some specific subclasses of automata."

The main contribution of this paper is to introduce the deterministic linear automata and even linear automata, i.e. the natural restriction of nondeterministic linear automata for the deterministic and even linear language classes, respectively. In particular, there are different, but not equivalents, proposals for the class of ""deterministic"" linear languages. We proved here that the class of languages accepted by the deterministic linear automata are not contained in any of the these classes and in fact they properly contain these classes. Another, contribution is the generation of an infinite hierarchy of formal languages, going from the class of languages accepted by deterministic linear automata and achieved, in the limit, the class of linear languages."

2016-11-30 10:20:54+00:00,2017-01-27 10:52:44+00:00,"Context-free and context-sensitive formal grammars are often regarded as more appropriate to model proteins than regular level models such as finite state automata and Hidden Markov Models. In theory, the claim is well founded in the fact that many biologically relevant interactions between residues of protein sequences have a character of nested or crossed dependencies. In practice, there is hardly any evidence that grammars of higher expressiveness have an edge over old good HMMs in typical applications including recognition and classification of protein sequences. This is in contrast to RNA modeling, where CFG power some of the most successful tools. There have been proposed several explanations of this phenomenon. On the biology side, one difficulty is that interactions in proteins are often less specific and more ""collective"" in comparison to RNA. On the modeling side, a difficulty is the larger alphabet which combined with high complexity of CF and CS grammars imposes considerable trade-offs consisting on information reduction or learning sub-optimal solutions. Indeed, some studies hinted that CF level of expressiveness brought an added value in protein modeling when CF and regular grammars where implemented in the same framework. However, there have been no systematic study of explanatory power provided by various grammatical models. The first step to this goal is define objective criteria of such evaluation. Intuitively, a decent explanatory grammar should generate topology, or the parse tree, consistent with topology of the protein, or its secondary and/or tertiary structure. In this piece of research we build on this intuition and propose a set of measures to compare topology of the parse tree of a grammar with topology of the protein structure."

Each binary word has an associated set of Parikh vectors of the factors of the word. Using prefix normal words, we provide a characterization of the equivalence class of binary words having the same set of Parikh vectors of their factors.   We prove that the language of prefix normal words is not context-free and is strictly contained in the language of pre-necklaces, which are prefixes of powers of Lyndon words.

The corresponding automaton model uses a network of identical finite-state machines that communicate in an asynchronous manner and whose state diagram must be acyclic except for self-loops. Exploiting the connection with logic, we also prove that the expressive power of those machines is independent of whether or not messages can be lost."

The present paper studies these questions for both polynomial-time and recursion-theoretic compression and ranking, and for almost every case arrives at a Closed, a Not-Closed, or a Closed-Iff-Well-Known-Complexity-Classes-Collapse result for the given operation. Even though compression and ranking classes are capturing something quite natural about the structure of sets, it turns out that they are quite fragile with respect to closure properties, and many fail to possess even the most basic of closure properties. For example, we show that with respect to the join (aka disjoint union) operation: the P-rankable sets are not closed, whether the semistrongly P-rankable sets are closed is closely linked to whether P = UP $\cap$ coUP, and the strongly P-rankable sets are closed."

Specifically, we prove that, in Winfree's abstract Tile Assembly Model, when restricted to use only noncooperative bindings, any long enough path starting from the seed that can grow in all terminal assemblies is pumpable, meaning that this path can be extended into an infinite, ultimately periodic path. This result can be seen as a geometric generalization of the pumping lemma of finite state automata, and closes the question of what can be computed deterministically in this model. Moreover, this question has motivated the development of a new method called visible glues. We believe that this method can also be used to tackle other long-standing problems in computational geometry, in relation for instance with self-avoiding paths. Tile assembly (including non-cooperative tile assembly) was originally introduced by Winfree and Rothemund in STOC 2000 to understand how to program shapes. The non-cooperative variant, also known as temperature 1 tile assembly, is the model where tiles are allowed to bind as soon as they match on one side, whereas in cooperative tile assembly, some tiles need to match on several sides in order to bind. Previously, exactly one known result (SODA 2014) showed a restriction on the assemblies general non-cooperative self-assembly could achieve, without any implication on its computational expressiveness. With non-square tiles (like polyominos, SODA 2015), other recent works have shown that the model quickly becomes computationally powerful."

We also prove EXPSPACE-hardness of this problem.

In our model programs are elements of programming spaces and viewed as maps from the virtual memory space to itself. Virtual memory space is an algebra of programs, an algebraic data structure one can calculate with. We define the operator of differentiation ($\partial$) on programming spaces and, using its powers, implement the general shift operator and the operator of program composition. We provide the formula for the expansion of a differentiable program into an infinite tensor series in terms of the powers of $\partial$. We express the operator of program composition in terms of the generalized shift operator and $\partial$, which implements a differentiable composition in the language. Such operators serve as abstractions over the tensor series algebra, as main actors in our language.

Inform. 43 (2007) 395-417], of whether all such multi-valued partial CFL functions can be refined by single-valued partial CFL functions. We negatively solve this open question by presenting a special multi-valued partial CFL function as an example function and by proving that no refinement of this particular function becomes a single-valued partial CFL function. This contrasts an early result of Kobayashi [Inform. Control 15 (1969) 95-109] that multi-valued partial NFA functions are always refined by single-valued NFA functions, where NFA functions are computed by one-way nondeterministic finite automata with output tapes. Our example function turns out to be unambiguously 2-valued, and thus we obtain a stronger separation result, in which no refinement of unambiguously 2-valued partial CFL functions can be single-valued. For the proof of this fact, we first introduce a new concept of colored automata having no output tapes but having ""colors,"" which can simulate pushdown automata equipped with constant-space output tapes. We then conduct an extensive combinatorial analysis on the behaviors of transition records of stack contents (called stack histories) of these colored automata."

Nondeterminism arises from both the choice of the initial state and the choice of actions, and the number of executions to be explored grows exponentially with their length. We introduce a notion of $\varepsilon$-independence relation over actions that relate approximately commutative actions; $\varepsilon$-equivalent action sequences are obtained by swapping $\varepsilon$-independent consecutive action pairs. Our reachability algorithm generalizes individual executions to cover sets of executions that start from different, but $\delta$-close initial states, and follow different, but $\varepsilon$-independent, action sequences. The constructed over-approximations can be made arbitrarily precise by reducing the $\delta,\varepsilon$ parameters. Exploiting both the continuity of actions and their approximate independence, the algorithm can yield an exponential reduction in the number of executions explored. We illustrate this with experiments on consensus, platooning, and distributed control examples."

A Real Number Automaton is an automaton which recognizes all encoding of elements of a set of reals. It is explained how to decide in linear time whether a set of reals recognized by a given minimal weak deterministic RNA is ${FO}[\mathbb R;+,<,1]$-definable. Furthermore, it is explained how to compute in quasi-quadratic (respectively, quasi-linear) time an existential (respectively, existential-universal) ${FO}[\mathbb R;+,<,1]$-formula which defines the set of reals recognized by the automaton. It is also shown that techniques given by Muchnik and by Honkala for automata over vector of natural numbers also works on vector of real numbers. It implies that some problems such as deciding whether a set of tuples of reals $R\subseteq\mathbb R^{d}$ is a subsemigroup of $(\mathbb R^{d},+)$ or is ${FO}[\mathbb R;+,<,1]$-definable is decidable."

Using methods from ergodic theory, we are able to partially resolve this conjecture, proving that any hypothetical counterexample is periodic away from a very sparse and structured set. In particular, we show that for a polynomial $p(n)$ with at least one irrational coefficient (except for the constant one) and integer $m$, the sequence $\lfloor p(n) \rfloor \bmod{m}$ is never automatic. We also obtain a conditional result, where we prove the conjecture under the assumption that the characteristic sequence of the set of powers of an integer $k\geq 2$ is not given by a generalised polynomial."

In the context of random generation of finite groups this means that it is hopeless to wish for a uniform distribution -- or even a non-trivial one -- by drawing random permutations and looking at the generated group. Mealy automata are a powerful tool to generate groups, including all finite groups and many interesting infinite ones, whence the idea of generating random finite groups by drawing random Mealy automata. In this paper we show that, for a special class of Mealy automata that generate only finite groups, the distribution is far from being uniform since the obtained groups are generically a semi-direct product between a direct product of alternating groups and a group generated by a tuple of transpositions."

In order to determine a particular value of this function, it is necessary to generate and classify a large number of Turing machines. Previous work on this problem has described the processes used for the generation and classification of these machines, but unfortunately has generally not provided details of the machines considered. While there is no reason to doubt the veracity of the results known so far, it is difficult to accept such results as scientifically proven without being able to inspect the appropriate evidence. In addition, a list of machines and their classifications can be used for other results, such as variations on the busy beaver problem and related problems such as the placid platypus problem. In this paper we investigate how to generate classes of machines to be considered for the busy beaver problem. We discuss the relationship between quadruple and quintuple variants of Turing machines, and show that the latter are more general than the former. We give some formal results to justify our strategy for minimising the number of machines generated, and define a process reflecting this strategy for generating machines. We describe our implementation, and the results of generating various classes of machines with up to 5 states or up to 5 symbols, all of which (together with our code) are available on the author's website."

Boolean operations over s-AFAs have linear complexity, which is in sharp contrast with the quadratic cost of intersection and union for non-alternating symbolic automata. Due to this succinctness, emptiness and equivalence checking are PSpace-hard.   We introduce an algorithm for checking the equivalence of two s-AFAs based on bisimulation up to congruence. This algorithm allows us to exploit the power of SAT and SMT solvers to efficiently search the state space of the s-AFAs. We evaluate our decision procedure on two verification and security applications: 1) checking satisfiability of linear temporal logic formulas over finite traces, and 2) checking equivalence of Boolean combinations of regular expressions. Our experiments show that our technique often outperforms existing techniques and it can be beneficial in both such applications."

And for which sets A does there exist such a mapping that respects the lexicographical ordering within A? Both cases are types of perfect, minimal hash functions. The complexity-theoretic versions of these notions are known as compression functions and ranking functions. The present paper defines and studies the recursion-theoretic versions of compression and ranking functions, and in particular studies the question of which sets have, or lack, such functions. Thus, this is a case where, in contrast to the usual direction of notion transferal, notions from complexity theory are inspiring notions, and an investigation, in computability theory.

First, we investigate the structure of the group of units $\text{ICA}(G;A)$ of $\text{CA}(G;A)$. We obtain a decomposition of $\text{ICA}(G;A)$ into a direct product of wreath products of groups that depends on the numbers $\alpha_{[H]}$ of periodic configurations for conjugacy classes $[H]$ of subgroups of $G$. We show how the numbers $\alpha_{[H]}$ may be computed using the M\""obius function of the subgroup lattice of $G$, and we use this to improve the lower bound recently found by Gao, Jackson and Seward on the number of aperiodic configurations of $A^G$. Furthermore, we study generating sets of $\text{CA}(G;A)$; in particular, we prove that $\text{CA}(G;A)$ cannot be generated by cellular automata with small memory set, and, when all subgroups of $G$ are normal, we determine the relative rank of $\text{ICA}(G;A)$ on $\text{CA}(G;A)$, i.e. the minimal size of a set $V \subseteq \text{CA}(G;A)$ such that $\text{CA}(G;A) = \langle \text{ICA}(G;A) \cup V \rangle$."

The first result is an algorithm that solves BCS when parameterized by the number of context switches (cs) and the size of the memory (m) in O*(m^(cs)2^(cs)). This is achieved by creating instances of the easier problem Shuff which we solve via fast subset convolution. We also present a lower bound for BCS of the form m^o(cs / log(cs)), based on the exponential time hypothesis. Interestingly, closing the gap means settling a conjecture that has been open since FOCS'07. Further, we prove that BCS admits no polynomial kernel.   Next, we introduce a measure, called scheduling dimension, that captures the complexity of schedules. We study BCS parameterized by the scheduling dimension (sdim) and show that it can be solved in O*((2m)^(4sdim)4^t)$, where t is the number of threads. We consider variants of the problem for which we obtain (matching) upper and lower bounds."

Parameterized systems provide a framework for modeling such networks. The analysis of parameterized systems is a challenge as some key properties such as nonblocking and deadlock-freedom are undecidable even for the case of a parameterized system with ring topology. In this paper, we introduce \textit{Parameterized-Chain Networks} (PCN) for modeling of networks containing several linear parameterized segments. Since deadlock analysis is undecidable, to achieve a tractable subproblem we limit the behavior of subprocesses of the network using our previously developed mathematical notion `weak invariant simulation.' We develop a dependency graph for analysis of PCN and show that partial and total deadlocks of the proposed PCN are characterized by full, consistent subgraphs of the dependency graph. We investigate deadlock in a traffic network as an illustrative example. This document contains all the details and proofs of the study."

In this paper, we investigate the role of the alphabet size. For each possible alphabet size, we count DFAs on $n \le 6$ states which synchronize in $(n-1)^2 - e$ steps, for all $e < 2\lceil n/2 \rceil$. Furthermore, we give constructions of automata with any number of states, and $3$, $4$, or $5$ symbols, which synchronize slowly, namely in $n^2 - 3n + O(1)$ steps.   In addition, our results prove \v{C}ern\'y's conjecture for $n \le 6$. Our computation has led to $27$ DFAs on $3$, $4$, $5$ or $6$ states, which synchronize in $(n-1)^2$ steps, but do not belong to \v{C}ern\'y's sequence. Of these $27$ DFA's, $19$ are new, and the remaining $8$ which were already known are exactly the \emph{minimal} ones: they will not synchronize any more after removing a symbol.   So the $19$ new DFAs are extensions of automata which were already known, including the \v{C}ern\'y automaton on $3$ states.

These graphs consist of a word structure augmented with two binary matching relations, one for each order of stack, which relate a push with matching pops (or collapse) on the respective stack. Due to the matching relations, satisfiability and model checking are undecidable. Hence we propose an under-approximation, bounding the number of times an order-1 push can be popped. With this under-approximation, which still allows unbounded stack height, we get decidability for satisfiability and model checking of both MSO and PDL. The problems are ExpTime-Complete for PDL."

In a previous work, Lechner et al. showed that model checking for flat freeze LTL on OCA with binary encoding of counter updates is decidable and in 2NEXPTIME. In this paper, we prove that the problem is, in fact, NEXPTIME-complete no matter whether counter updates are encoded in unary or binary. Like Lechner et al., we rely on a reduction to the reachability problem in OCA with parameterized tests (OCA(P)). The new aspect is that we simulate OCA(P) by alternating two-way automata over words. This implies an exponential upper bound on the parameter values that we exploit towards an NP algorithm for reachability in OCA(P) with unary updates. We obtain our main result as a corollary. As another application, relying on a reduction by Bundala and Ouaknine, one obtains an alternative proof of the known fact that reachability in closed parametric timed automata with one parametric clock is in NEXPTIME."

However, their very nature provides no guarantee on time bounds within which something good can be witnessed. In this work, we consider two approaches toward inclusion of time bounds in parity games. The first one, parity-response games, is based on the notion of finitary parity games [CHH09] and parity games with costs [FZ14,WZ16]. The second one, window parity games, is inspired by window mean-payoff games [CDRR15]. We compare the two approaches and show that while they prove to be equivalent in some contexts, window parity games offer a more tractable alternative when the time bound is given as a parameter (P-c. vs. PSPACE-C.). In particular, it provides a conservative approximation of parity games computable in polynomial time. Furthermore, we extend both approaches to the multi-dimension setting.

It is known that if $L'_m$ and $L_n$ are languages of state complexities $m$ and $n$, respectively, and restricted to the same alphabet, the state complexity of any binary boolean operation on $L'_m$ and $L_n$ is $mn$, and that of product (concatenation) is $m 2^n - 2^{n-1}$. In contrast to this, we show that if $L'_m$ and $L_n$ are over different alphabets, the state complexity of union and symmetric difference is $(m+1)(n+1)$, that of difference is $mn+m$, that of intersection is $mn$, and that of product is $m2^n+2^{n-1}$. We also study unrestricted complexity of binary operations in the classes of regular right, left, and two-sided ideals, and derive tight upper bounds. The bounds for product of the unrestricted cases (with the bounds for the restricted cases in parentheses) are as follows: right ideals $m+2^{n-2}+2^{n-1}$ ($m+2^{n-2}$); left ideals $mn+m+n$ ($m+n-1$); two-sided ideals $m+2n$ ($m+n-1$). The state complexities of boolean operations on all three types of ideals are the same as those of arbitrary regular languages, whereas that is not the case if the alphabets of the arguments are the same.

Its application usually reduces to solving specific decision problems such as model checking and satisfiability. In these kind of problems, the solution often requires detecting some specific properties over cycles. For instance, this happens when using classic techniques based on automata, game-theory, SCC decomposition, and the like. Surprisingly, no temporal logics have been considered so far with the explicit ability of talking about cycles.   In this paper we introduce Cycle-CTL*, an extension of the classical branching-time temporal logic CTL* along with cycle quantifications in order to predicate over cycles. This logic turns out to be very expressive. Indeed, we prove that it strictly extends CTL* and is orthogonal to mu-calculus. We also give an evidence of its usefulness by providing few examples involving non-regular properties.   We investigate the model checking problem for Cycle-CTL* and show that it is PSPACE-Complete as for CTL*. We also study the satisfiability problem for the existential-cycle fragment of the logic and show that it is solvable in 2ExpTime. This result makes use of an automata-theoretic approach along with novel ad-hoc definitions of bisimulation and tree-like unwinding."

We show that the number and parity of priorities available to an APKA form a proper hierarchy of expressive power as in the modal mu-calculus. This also induces a strict alternation hierarchy on HFL. The proof follows Arnold's (1999) encoding of runs into trees and subsequent use of the Banach Fixpoint Theorem."

2016-09-12 16:10:28+00:00,2017-06-23 09:35:17+00:00,"Partially ordered nondeterminsitic finite automata (poNFAs) are NFAs whose transition relation induces a partial order on states, that is, for which cycles occur only in the form of self-loops on a single state. A poNFA is universal if it accepts all words over its input alphabet. Deciding universality is PSPACE-complete for poNFAs, and we show that this remains true even when restricting to a fixed alphabet. This is nontrivial since standard encodings of alphabet symbols in, e.g., binary can turn self-loops into longer cycles. A lower coNP-complete complexity bound can be obtained if we require that all self-loops in the poNFA are deterministic, in the sense that the symbol read in the loop cannot occur in any other transition from that state. We find that such restricted poNFAs (rpoNFAs) characterise the class of $\mathcal{R}$-trivial languages, and we establish the complexity of deciding if the language of an NFA is $\mathcal{R}$-trivial. Nevertheless, the limitation to fixed alphabets turns out to be essential even in the restricted case: deciding universality of rpoNFAs with unbounded alphabets is PSPACE-complete. Based on a close relation between universality and the problems of inclusion and equivalence, we also obtain the complexity results for these two problems. Finaly, we show that the languages of rpoNFAs are definable by deterministic (one-unambiguous) regular expressions, which makes them interesting in schema languages for XML data."
2016-09-11 19:22:58+00:00,2016-09-11 19:22:58+00:00,"The words separation problem, originally formulated by Goralcik and Koubek (1986), is stated as follows. Let $Sep(n)$ be the minimum number such that for any two words of length $\le n$ there is a deterministic finite automaton with $Sep(n)$ states, accepting exactly one of them. The problem is to find the asymptotics of the function $Sep$. This problem is inverse to finding the asymptotics of the length of the shortest identity in full transformation semigroups $T_k$. The known lower bound on $Sep$ stems from the unary identity in $T_k$. We find the first series of identities in $T_k$ which are shorter than the corresponding unary identity for infinitely many values of $k$, and thus slightly improve the lower bound on $Sep(n)$. Then we present some short positive identities in symmetric groups, improving the lower bound on separating words by permutational automata by a multiplicative constant. Finally, we present the results of computer search for short identities for small $k$."
2016-09-11 10:20:48+00:00,2016-09-11 10:20:48+00:00,"In computer science, divide and conquer (D&C) is an algorithm design paradigm based on multi-branched recursion. A D&C algorithm works by recursively and monotonically breaking down a problem into sub problems of the same (or a related) type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem. The present work identifies D&C algorithms assumed within contemporary syntactic theory, and discusses the limits of their applicability in the realms of the syntax semantics and syntax morphophonology interfaces. We will propose that D&C algorithms, while valid for some processes, fall short on flexibility given a mixed approach to the structure of linguistic phrase markers. Arguments in favour of a computationally mixed approach to linguistic structure will be presented as an alternative that offers advantages to uniform D&C approaches."

Therefore, we suggest a unique perspective on this central issue, to which we would like to refer as to transparent connectionism, by proposing accounts of how symbolic computation can be implemented in neural substrates. In this study we first introduce a new model of dynamics on a symbolic space, the versatile shift, showing that it supports the real-time simulation of a range of automata. We then show that the Goedelization of versatile shifts defines nonlinear dynamical automata, dynamical systems evolving on a vectorial space. Finally, we present a mapping between nonlinear dynamical automata and recurrent artificial neural networks. The mapping defines an architecture characterized by its granular modularity, where data, symbolic operations and their control are not only distinguishable in activation space, but also spatially localizable in the network itself, while maintaining a distributed encoding of symbolic representations. The resulting networks simulate automata in real-time and are programmed directly, in absence of network training. To discuss the unique characteristics of the architecture and their consequences, we present two examples: i) the design of a Central Pattern Generator from a finite-state locomotive controller, and ii) the creation of a network simulating a system of interactive automata that supports the parsing of garden-path sentences as investigated in psycholinguistics experiments."

In this paper, we depict a reduction procedure tailored for a given reachability property of the form ``from global state s there exists a sequence of transitions leading to a state where an automaton g is in a local state T'. By exploiting a causality analysis of the transitions within the individual automata, the proposed reduction removes local transitions while preserving all the minimal traces that satisfy the reachability property. The complexity of the procedure is polynomial in the total number of local states and transitions, and exponential in the number of local states within one automaton. Applied to automata networks modelling dynamics of biological systems, we observe that the reduction shrinks down significantly the reachable state space, enhancing the tractability of the model-checking of large networks."

There has been a large number of different types of attacks discussed in the modern control and computer science communities. In this paper we aim to investigate one special type of attacks in the discrete-event system framework, where an attacker can arbitrarily alter sensor readings after intercepting them from a target system in order to trick a given supervisor to issue control commands improperly, driving the system to an undesirable state. We first consider the cyber attack problem from an attacker point of view, and formulate an attack with bounded sensor reading alterations (ABSRA) problem. We then show that the supremal (or least restrictive) ABSRA exists and can be synthesized, as long as the plant model and the supervisor model are regular, i.e., representable by finite-state automata. Upon the synthesis of the supremal ABSRA, we present a synthesis algorithm, which ensures that a computed supervisor will be ABSRA-robust , i.e., either an ABSRA will be detectable or will not lead the system to an undesirable state."

The first is a series of automata with subsets whose shortest extending words are of length $\varTheta(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of states of the automaton. This disproves a conjecture that every subset in a strongly connected synchronizing automaton is $cn$-extendable, for some constant $c$, and in particular, shows that the cubic upper bound on the length of the shortest reset words cannot be improved generally by means of the extension method. A detailed analysis shows that the automata in the series have subsets that require words as long as $n^2/4+O(n)$ in order to be extended by at least one element.   We also discuss possible relaxations of the conjecture, and propose the image-extension conjecture, which would lead to a quadratic upper bound on the length of the shortest reset words. In this regard we present another class of automata, which turn out to be counterexamples to a key claim in a recent attempt to improve the Pin-Frankl bound for reset words.   Finally, we present two new series of slowly irreducibly synchronizing automata over a ternary alphabet, whose lengths of the shortest reset words are $n^2-3n+3$ and $n^2-3n+2$, respectively. These are the first examples of such series of automata for alphabets of size larger than two."

In this paper, we investigate more restricted cases for both models to recognize uncountably many languages with bounded error. We show that double logarithmic space is enough for PTMs on unary languages in sweeping reading mode or logarithmic space for one-way head. On unary languages, for quantum models, we obtain middle logarithmic space for counter machines. For binary languages, arbitrary small non-constant space is enough for PTMs even using only counter as memory. For counter machines, when restricted to polynomial time, we can obtain the same result for linear space. For constant--space QTMs, we follow the result for a restricted sweeping head, known as restarting realtime."

Brenguier, Cassez, and Raskin recently studied a variation of these games and showed that mean-payoff games are undecidable for timed automata with five or more clocks. We refine this result by proving the undecidability of mean-payoff games with three clocks. On a positive side, we show the decidability of mean-payoff games on one-clock timed automata with binary price-rates.

We present a method that - in contrast to existing techniques - tackles both aspects with the best suited approach and works exclusively on the 2.5 player game itself. The resulting technique is powerful enough to handle games with several million states.
2016-07-04 15:30:04+00:00,2016-10-19 02:21:20+00:00,"Many different deletion operations are investigated applied to languages accepted by one-way and two-way deterministic reversal-bounded multicounter machines, deterministic pushdown automata, and finite automata. Operations studied include the prefix, suffix, infix and outfix operations, as well as left and right quotient with languages from different families. It is often expected that language families defined from deterministic machines will not be closed under deletion operations. However, here, it is shown that one-way deterministic reversal-bounded multicounter languages are closed under right quotient with languages from many different language families; even those defined by nondeterministic machines such as the context-free languages. Also, it is shown that when starting with one-way deterministic machines with one counter that makes only one reversal, taking the left quotient with languages from many different language families -- again including those defined by nondeterministic machines such as the context-free languages -- yields only one-way deterministic reversal-bounded multicounter languages (by increasing the number of counters). However, if there are two more reversals on the counter, or a second 1-reversal-bounded counter, taking the left quotient (or even just the suffix operation) yields languages that can neither be accepted by deterministic reversal-bounded multicounter machines, nor by 2-way nondeterministic machines with one reversal-bounded counter."

In this paper, we replace the single tape of 1-way 2-head quantum finite state automaton with two tapes. The content of the second tape is determined using a relation defined on input alphabet. The main claims of this paper are as follows: (1)We establish that 2-tape 1-way quantum finite state automaton(2T1QFA(2)) can accept all regular languages (2)A language which cannot be accepted by any multi-head deterministic finite automaton can be accepted by 2-tape 1-way quantum finite state automaton(2T1QFA(2)) .(3) Exploiting the superposition property of quantum automata we show that 2-tape 1-way quantum finite state automaton(2T1QFA(2)) can accept the language L=ww."

Recently it was shown to be decidable for linear, shallow systems. We generalize this previous result and show that this property is decidable for shallow rewrite systems, in contrast to confluence, reachability and other properties, which are all undecidable for flat systems. Our result is also optimal in some sense, since we prove that the $UN^=$ property is undecidable for two classes of linear rewrite systems: left-flat systems in which right-hand sides are of depth at most two and right-flat systems in which left-hand sides are of depth at most two."

For more detailed analyses, the number of text character accesses $X^{\mathcal{A},S}_n$ performed by an algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ when searching a random text of length $n$ for a fixed pattern $S$ has been considered. Constructing a state space and corresponding transition rules (e.g. in a Markov chain) that reflect the behavior of a pattern matching algorithm is a key step in existing analyses of $X^{\mathcal{A},S}_n$ in both the asymptotic ($n\to\infty$) and the non-asymptotic regime. The size of this state space is hence a crucial parameter for such analyses. In this paper, we introduce a general methodology to construct corresponding state spaces and demonstrate that it applies to a wide range of algorithms, including Boyer-Moore (BM), Boyer-Moore-Horspool (BMH), Backward Oracle Matching (BOM), and Backward (Non-Deterministic) DAWG Matching (B(N)DM). In all cases except BOM, our method leads to state spaces of size $O(m^3)$ for pattern length $m$, a result that has previously only been obtained for BMH. In all other cases, only state spaces with size exponential in $m$ had been reported. Our results immediately imply an algorithm to compute the distribution of $X^{\mathcal{A},S}_n$ for fixed $S$, fixed $n$, and $\mathcal{A}\in\{\text{BM},\text{BMH},\text{B(N)DM}\}$ in polynomial time for a very general class of random text models."

A modal refinement relation on IR-MIA allows distinguishing between obligatory and allowed output behaviors, as well as between implicitly underspecified and explicitly forbidden input behaviors. The theory therefore supports positive and negative conformance testing with optimistic and pessimistic environmental assumptions. We further show that the resulting conformance relation on IR-MIA, called modal-irioco, enjoys many desirable properties concerning component-based behaviors. First, modal-irioco is preserved under modal refinement and constitutes a preorder under certain restrictions which can be ensured by a canonical input completion for IR-MIA. Second, under the same restrictions, modal-irioco is compositional with respect to parallel composition of IR-MIA with multi-cast and hiding. Finally, the quotient operator on IR-MIA, as the inverse to parallel composition, facilitates decompositionality in conformance testing to solve the unknown-component problem."

In particular, we show that, when the automata halt ""in finite steps"" along all computation paths, they must terminate in worst-case liner time. In the bounded-error probability case, the acceptance of the automata depends only on the computation paths that terminate within exponentially many steps even if not all computation paths may terminate. We also present a classical simulation of those automata on two-way multi-head probabilistic finite automata with cut points. Moreover, we discuss how the recognition power of the automata varies as the automata's acceptance criteria change to error free, one-sided error, bounded error, and unbounded error by comparing the complexity of their computational powers. We further note that, with the use of arbitrary complex transition amplitudes, two-way unbounded-error quantum finite automata and two-way bounded-error 2-head quantum finite automata can recognize certain non-recursive languages, whereas two-way error-free quantum finite automata recognize only recursive languages."

Nested weighted automata are strictly more expressive than weighted automata (e.g., average response time can be expressed with nested weighted automata), but the basic decision questions have higher complexity (e.g., for deterministic automata, the emptiness question for nested weighted automata is PSPACE-hard, whereas the corresponding complexity for weighted automata is PTIME). We consider a natural subclass of nested weighted automata where at any point at most a bounded number k of slave automata can be active. We focus on automata whose master value function is the limit average. We show that these nested weighted automata with bounded width are strictly more expressive than weighted automata (e.g., average response time with no overlapping requests can be expressed with bound k=1, but not with non-nested weighted automata). We show that the complexity of the basic decision problems (i.e., emptiness and universality) for the subclass with k constant matches the complexity for weighted automata. Moreover, when k is part of the input given in unary we establish PSPACE-completeness."

However, their very nature provides no guarantee on time bounds within which something good can be witnessed. In this work, we consider two approaches toward inclusion of time bounds in parity games. The first one, parity-response games, is based on the notion of finitary parity games [CHH09] and parity games with costs [FZ14,WZ16]. The second one, window parity games, is inspired by window mean-payoff games [CDRR15]. We compare the two approaches and show that while they prove to be equivalent in some contexts, window parity games offer a more tractable alternative when the time bound is given as a parameter (P-c. vs. PSPACE-c.). In particular, it provides a conservative approximation of parity games computable in polynomial time. Furthermore, we extend both approaches to the multi-dimension setting.

Nested words are words with a nesting structure, allowing to model unranked trees as their depth-first-search linearisations. In this paper, we consider transformations from nested words to words, allowing in particular to produce unranked trees if output words have a nesting structure. The model of visibly pushdown transducers allows to describe such transformations, and we propose a simple deterministic extension of this model with two-way moves that has the following properties: i) it is a simple computational model, that naturally has a good evaluation complexity; ii) it is expressive: it subsumes nested word-to-word MSO transducers, and the exact expressiveness of MSO transducers is recovered using a simple syntactic restriction; iii) it has good algorithmic/closure properties: the model is closed under composition with a unambiguous one-way letter-to-letter transducer which gives closure under regular look-around, and has a decidable equivalence problem."

They are the generalization to two dimensions of the cross-bifix-free sets of strings. Non-overlapping sets of pictures are non-expandable when no other picture can be added without violating the property. We present a construction of non-expandable non-overlapping (NENO) sets of pictures and show some examples of application.
2016-05-26 14:00:02+00:00,2018-01-18 16:13:18+00:00,"We provide a counterexample to a conjecture by Thiagarajan (1996 and 2002) that regular event structures correspond exactly to event structures obtained as unfoldings of finite 1-safe Petri nets. The same counterexample is used to disprove a closely related conjecture by Badouel, Darondeau, and Raoult (1999) that domains of regular event structures with bounded $\natural$-cliques are recognizable by finite trace automata. Event structures, trace automata, and Petri nets are fundamental models in concurrency theory. There exist nice interpretations of these structures as combinatorial and geometric objects. Namely, from a graph theoretical point of view, the domains of prime event structures correspond exactly to median graphs; from a geometric point of view, these domains are in bijection with CAT(0) cube complexes.   A necessary condition for both conjectures to be true is that domains of regular event structures (with bounded $\natural$-cliques) admit a regular nice labeling. To disprove these conjectures, we describe a regular event domain (with bounded $\natural$-cliques) that does not admit a regular nice labeling. Our counterexample is derived from an example by Wise (1996 and 2007) of a nonpositively curved square complex whose universal cover is a CAT(0) square complex containing a particular plane with an aperiodic tiling. We prove that other counterexamples to Thiagarajan's conjecture arise from aperiodic 4-way deterministic tile sets of Kari and Papasoglu (1999) and Lukkarila (2009).   On the positive side, using breakthrough results by Agol (2013) and Haglund and Wise (2008, 2012) from geometric group theory, we prove that Thiagarajan's conjecture is true for regular event structures whose domains occur as principal filters of hyperbolic CAT(0) cube complexes which are universal covers of finite nonpositively curved cube complexes."

In this paper we study this problem for finite state machines with inputs and outputs, and in particular for Moore machines. We develop three algorithms for solving this problem: (1) the PTAP algorithm, which transforms a set of input-output traces into an incomplete Moore machine and then completes the machine with self-loops; (2) the PRPNI algorithm, which uses the well-known RPNI algorithm for automata learning to learn a product of automata encoding a Moore machine; and (3) the MooreMI algorithm, which directly learns a Moore machine using PTAP extended with state merging. We prove that MooreMI has the fundamental identification in the limit property. We also compare the algorithms experimentally in terms of the size of the learned machine and several notions of accuracy, introduced in this paper. Finally, we compare with OSTIA, an algorithm that learns a more general class of transducers, and find that OSTIA generally does not learn a Moore machine, even when fed with a characteristic sample."

We ask the question of whether the game has maxmin 1, in other words we ask whether for all $\epsilon>0$ there exists a deterministic strategy for the (blind) maximizer such that against all the strategies of the minimizer, it is possible to reach the set of final states with probability larger than $1-\epsilon$. This problem is undecidable in general, but we define a class of games, called leaktight half-blind games where the problem becomes decidable. We also show that mixed strategies in general are stronger for both players and that optimal strategies for the minimizer might require infinite-memory."

Restricted NMF requires in addition that the column spaces of $M$ and $W$ coincide. Finding the minimal inner dimension $d$ is known to be NP-hard, both for NMF and restricted NMF. We show that restricted NMF is closely related to a question about the nature of minimal probabilistic automata, posed by Paz in his seminal 1971 textbook. We use this connection to answer Paz's question negatively, thus falsifying a positive answer claimed in 1974. Furthermore, we investigate whether a rational matrix $M$ always has a restricted NMF of minimal inner dimension whose factors $W$ and $H$ are also rational. We show that this holds for matrices $M$ of rank at most $3$ and we exhibit a rank-$4$ matrix for which $W$ and $H$ require irrational entries."

In particular, we find the quotient/state complexity of boolean operations, product (concatenation), star, and reversal, the size of the syntactic semigroup, and the quotient complexity of atoms. For binary operations we use arguments with different alphabets when appropriate; this leads to higher tight upper bounds than those obtained with equal alphabets.

They can emulate context-free grammars, regular tree grammars, and synchronous grammars, allowing us to work with all these generating systems in a unified way. The theory of bud generating systems uses colored operads. Indeed, an object is generated by a bud generating system if it satisfies a certain equation in a colored operad. To compute the generating series of the languages of bud generating systems, we introduce formal power series on colored operads and several operations on these. Series on colored operads are crucial to express the languages specified by bud generating systems and allow us to enumerate combinatorial objects with respect to some statistics. Some examples of bud generating systems are constructed; in particular to specify some sorts of balanced trees and to obtain recursive formulas enumerating these."

We then reduce the problem to solving an optimisation problem, allowing to decide the satisfaction of the formula using an SMT solver. The algorithm works also for interval Markov chains. The complexity is linear in the size of the Markov chain, and exponential in the size of the formula. We provide a prototype and show the efficiency of our approach on a number of benchmarks."

Is this n approximately 10, or closer to 1,000,000, or is it even larger? In this paper, we show that it is at most 7,910 by presenting an explicit description of a 7,910-state Turing machine Z with 1 tape and a 2-symbol alphabet that cannot be proved to run forever in ZFC (even though it presumably does), assuming ZFC is consistent. The machine is based on the work of Harvey Friedman on independent statements involving order-invariant graphs. In doing so, we give the first known upper bound on the highest provable Busy Beaver number in ZFC. To create Z, we develop and use a higher-level language, Laconic, which is much more convenient than direct state manipulation. We also use Laconic to design two Turing machines, G and R, that halt if and only if there are counterexamples to Goldbach's Conjecture and the Riemann Hypothesis, respectively."

It is well-known that the downward closure of every language is regular. Moreover, recent results show that downward closures are computable for quite powerful system models.   One advantage of abstracting a language by its downward closure is that then equivalence and inclusion become decidable. In this work, we study the complexity of these two problems. More precisely, we consider the following decision problems: Given languages $K$ and $L$ from classes $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$, respectively, does the downward closure of $K$ include (equal) that of $L$?   These problems are investigated for finite automata, one-counter automata, context-free grammars, and reversal-bounded counter automata. For each combination, we prove a completeness result either for fixed or for arbitrary alphabets.

We represent pk-structures as orientable fatgraphs, which naturally leads to a filtration by their topological genus. Within this framework, RNA secondary structures correspond to pk-structures of genus zero. {\it RNAFeatures$^*$} acts on formal, arc-labeled RNA secondary structures, called $\lambda$-structures. $\lambda$-structures correspond one-to-one to pk-structures together with some additional information. This information consists of the specific rearrangement of the backbone, by which a pk-structure can be made cross-free. {\it RNAFeatures$^*$} is an extension of the grammar for secondary structures and employs an enhancement by labelings of the symbols as well as the production rules. We discuss how to use {\it RNAFeatures$^*$} to obtain a stochastic context-free grammar for pk-structures, using data of RNA sequences and structures. The induced grammar facilitates fast Boltzmann sampling and statistical analysis. As a first application, we present an $O(n log(n))$ runtime algorithm which samples pk-structures based on ninety tRNA sequences and structures from the Nucleic Acid Database (NDB)."

On one hand, starting from a global mission that is specified as a regular language over all the agents' mission capabilities, a mission planning layer sits on the top of the proposed framework, decomposing the global mission into local tasks that are in consistency with each agent's individual capabilities, and compositionally justifying whether the achievement of local tasks implies the satisfaction of the global mission via an assume-guarantee paradigm. On the other hand, bottom-up motion plans associated with each agent are synthesized corresponding to the obtained local missions by composing basic motion primitives, which are verified safe by differential dynamic logic (d$\mathcal{L}$), through a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver that searches feasible solutions in face of constraints imposed by local task requirements and the environment description. It is shown that the proposed framework can handle dynamical environments as the motion primitives possess reactive features, making the motion plans adaptive to local environmental changes. Furthermore, on-line mission reconfiguration can be triggered by the motion planning layer once no feasible solutions can be found through the SMT solver. The effectiveness of the overall design framework is validated by an automated warehouse case study."

Due to the scheduling policy of the platform, the inputs may arrive at the reducers in different order. The commutativity problem of reducers asks if the output of a reducer is independent of the order of its inputs. Although the problem is undecidable in general, the MapReduce programs in practice are usually used for data analytics and thus require very simple control flow. By exploiting the simplicity, we propose a programming language for reducers where the commutativity problem is decidable. The main idea of the reducer language is to separate the control and data flow of programs and disallow arithmetic operations in the control flow. The decision procedure for the commutativity problem is obtained through a reduction to the equivalence problem of streaming numerical transducers (SNTs), a novel automata model over infinite alphabets introduced in this paper. The design of SNTs is inspired by streaming transducers (Alur and Cerny, POPL 2011). Nevertheless, the two models are intrinsically different since the outputs of SNTs are integers while those of streaming transducers are data words. The decidability of the equivalence of SNTs is achieved with an involved combinatorial analysis of the evolvement of the values of the integer variables during the runs of SNTs."

A complete view on the Internet backbone routing is given by the collection of all valid routes, which is infeasible to obtain due to information hiding of BGP, the lack of omnipresent collection points, and data complexity. Commonly, graph-based data models are used to represent the Internet topology from a given set of BGP routing tables but fall short of explaining policy contexts. As a consequence, routing anomalies such as route leaks and interception attacks cannot be explained with graphs.   In this paper, we use formal languages to represent the global routing system in a rigorous model. Our CAIR framework translates BGP announcements into a finite route language that allows for the incremental construction of minimal route automata. CAIR preserves route diversity, is highly efficient, and well-suited to monitor BGP path changes in real-time. We formally derive implementable search patterns for route leaks and interception attacks. In contrast to the state-of-the-art, we can detect these incidents.

The main idea is to consider timed behaviors as graphs with matching edges capturing timing constraints. When a family of graphs has bounded tree-width, they can be interpreted in trees and MSO-definable properties of such graphs can be checked using tree automata. The technique is quite general and applies to many timed systems. In this paper, as an example, we develop the technique on timed pushdown systems, which have recently received considerable attention. Further, we also demonstrate how we can use it on timed automata and timed multi-stack pushdown systems (with boundedness restrictions)."

We show that, in general, the set of singular points has measure zero. Then we focus our attention on several classes of automata.

Often, a specification contains both Boolean requirements that should be satisfied against an adversarial environment, and multi-valued components that refer to the quality of the satisfaction and whose expected cost we would like to minimize with respect to a probabilistic environment.   In this work we study, for the first time, mean-payoff games in which the system aims at minimizing the expected cost against a probabilistic environment, while surely satisfying an $\omega$-regular condition against an adversarial environment. We consider the case the $\omega$-regular condition is given as a parity objective or by an LTL formula. We show that in general, optimal strategies need not exist, and moreover, the limit value cannot be approximated by finite-memory strategies. We thus focus on computing the limit-value, and give tight complexity bounds for synthesizing $\epsilon$-optimal strategies for both finite-memory and infinite-memory strategies.   We show that our game naturally arises in various contexts of synthesis with Boolean and multi-valued objectives. Beyond direct applications, in synthesis with costs and rewards to certain behaviors, it allows us to compute the minimal sensing cost of $\omega$-regular specifications -- a measure of quality in which we look for a transducer that minimizes the expected number of signals that are read from the input."

For a well-studied and wide class of quantitative functions, we establish that automata with monitor counters and nested weighted automata are equivalent. We study for the first time such quantitative automata under probabilistic semantics. We show that several problems that are undecidable for the classical questions of emptiness and universality become decidable under the probabilistic semantics. We present a complete picture of decidability for such automata, and even an almost-complete picture of computational complexity, for the probabilistic questions we consider."
2016-04-22 16:52:58+00:00,2016-04-22 16:52:58+00:00,"This article introduces ATAB, a tool that automatically generates pairwise reachability checks for action trees. Action trees can be used to study the behaviour of real-world concurrent programs. ATAB encodes pairwise reachability checks into alternating tree automata that determine whether an action tree has a schedule where any pair of given points in the program are simultaneously reachable. Because the pairwise reachability problem is undecidable in general ATAB operates under a restricted form of lock-based concurrency. ATAB produces alternating tree automata that are more compact and more efficiently checkable than those that have been previously used. The process is entirely automated, which simplifies the process of encoding checks for more complex action trees. The alternating tree automata produced are easier to scale to large numbers of locks than previous constructions."

The transducer can be easily customized to either follow the POSIX or Greedy disambiguation policy and based on a finite set of examples it is possible to examine if there are any differences among POSIX and Greedy.

In a non-uniform cellular automaton (CA), different cells may follow different rules. The present work considers that the cells follow Wolfram's CAs rules. A characterization tool, named Reachability tree is used to discover the number conservation property of non-uniform CAs.

Finally, a synthesis scheme is developed to get an $n$-cell number conserving non-uniform CA."

A property is synchronized in a system if it holds in all paths of a certain length. The new logic is obtained by using the same path quantifiers and temporal operators as in CTL, but allowing a different order of the quantifiers. This small syntactic variation induces a logic that can express non-regular properties for which known extensions of MSO with equality of path length are undecidable. We show that our variant of CTL is decidable and that the model-checking problem is in Delta_3^P = P^{NP^NP}, and is DP-hard. We analogously consider quantifier exchange in extensions of CTL, and we present operators defined using basic operators of CTL* that express the occurrence of infinitely many synchronization points. We show that the model-checking problem remains in Delta_3^P. The distinguishing power of CTL and of our new logic coincide if the Next operator is allowed in the logics, thus the classical bisimulation quotient can be used for state-space reduction before model checking."

In DIOA, automata can be created and destroyed dynamically, as computation proceeds, and an automaton can dynamically change its signature, i.e., the set of actions in which it can participate.   DIOA features operators for parallel composition, action hiding, action renaming, a notion of automaton creation, and a notion of behavioral subtyping by means of trace inclusion. DIOA can model mobility, using signature modification, and is hierarchical: a dynamically changing system of interacting automata is itself modeled as a single automaton.   We also show that parallel composition, action hiding, action renaming, and (subject to some technical conditions) automaton creation are all monotonic with respect to trace inclusion: if one component is replaced by another whose traces are a subset of the former, then the set of traces of the system as a whole can only be reduced."

Our algorithm relies on a translation of the numerical problem on matrices into combinatorial problems on words.

We consider Abelian squares, parameterized squares, and order-preserving squares. The word $uv$ is an Abelian (parameterized, order-preserving) square if $u$ and $v$ are equivalent in the Abelian (parameterized, order-preserving) sense. The maximum number of ordinary squares in a word is known to be asymptotically linear, but the exact bound is still investigated. We present several results on the maximum number of distinct squares for nonstandard subword equivalence relations. Let $\mathit{SQ}_{\mathrm{Abel}}(n,\sigma)$ and $\mathit{SQ}'_{\mathrm{Abel}}(n,\sigma)$ denote the maximum number of Abelian squares in a word of length $n$ over an alphabet of size $\sigma$, which are distinct as words and which are nonequivalent in the Abelian sense, respectively. For $\sigma\ge 2$ we prove that $\mathit{SQ}_{\mathrm{Abel}}(n,\sigma)=\Theta(n^2)$, $\mathit{SQ}'_{\mathrm{Abel}}(n,\sigma)=\Omega(n^{3/2})$ and $\mathit{SQ}'_{\mathrm{Abel}}(n,\sigma) = O(n^{11/6})$. We also give linear bounds for parameterized and order-preserving squares for alphabets of constant size: $\mathit{SQ}_{\mathrm{param}}(n,O(1))=\Theta(n)$, $\mathit{SQ}_{\mathrm{op}}(n,O(1))=\Theta(n)$. The upper bounds have quadratic dependence on the alphabet size for order-preserving squares and exponential dependence for parameterized squares.   As a side result we construct infinite words over the smallest alphabet which avoid nontrivial order-preserving squares and nontrivial parameterized cubes (nontrivial parameterized squares cannot be avoided in an infinite word)."

This is one of possible extensions generalizing words and variable-length codes to planar structures. Here, verification whether a given set is a code is no longer decidable in general. We study the decidability status of figure codes depending on catenation type (with or without a merging function), decipherability kind (unique, multiset, set or numeric) and code geometry (several classes determined by relative positions of start and end points of figures).

A probability distribution is p-synchronizing if the probability mass is at least p in a single state, or in a given set of states. We consider four temporal synchronizing modes: a sequence of probability distributions is always p-synchronizing, eventually p-synchronizing, weakly p-synchronizing, or strongly p-synchronizing if, respectively, all, some, infinitely many, or all but finitely many distributions in the sequence are p-synchronizing.   For each synchronizing mode, an MDP can be (i) sure winning if there is a strategy that produces a 1-synchronizing sequence; (ii) almost-sure winning if there is a strategy that produces a sequence that is, for all epsilon > 0, a (1-epsilon)-synchronizing sequence; (iii) limit-sure winning if for all epsilon > 0, there is a strategy that produces a (1-epsilon)-synchronizing sequence.   We provide fundamental results on the expressiveness, decidability, and complexity of synchronizing properties for MDPs. For each synchronizing mode, we consider the problem of deciding whether an MDP is sure, almost-sure, or limit-sure winning, and we establish matching upper and lower complexity bounds of the problems: for all winning modes, we show that the problems are PSPACE-complete for eventually and weakly synchronizing, and PTIME-complete for always and strongly synchronizing. We establish the memory requirement for winning strategies, and we show that all winning modes coincide for always synchronizing, and that the almost-sure and limit-sure winning modes coincide for weakly and strongly synchronizing."

This leads to a setting that is well-suited for applying existing tools from Stone duality as applied in semantics. The main focus of the paper is the development of topo-algebraic constructions pertinent to the treatment of languages given by logic formulas. In particular, using the standard semantic view of quantification as projection, we derive a notion of Sch\""utzenberger product for Boolean spaces with internal monoids. This makes heavy use of the Vietoris construction, and its dual functor, which is central to the coalgebraic treatment of classical modal logic. We show that the unary Sch\""utzenberger product for spaces, when applied to a recogniser for the language associated to a formula with a free first-order variable, yields a recogniser for the language of all models of the corresponding existentially quantified formula. Further, we generalise global and local versions of the theorems of Sch\""utzenberger and Reutenauer characterising the languages recognised by the binary Sch\""utzenberger product. Finally, we provide an equational characterisation of Boolean algebras obtained by local Sch\""utzenberger product with the one element space based on an Egli-Milner type condition on generalised factorisations of ultrafilters on words."
2016-03-25 14:24:43+00:00,2016-03-25 14:24:43+00:00,"The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a complex language, and consequently, XML-based protocols are susceptible to entire classes of implicit and explicit security problems. Message formats in XML-based protocols are usually specified in XML Schema, and as a first-line defense, schema validation should reject malformed input. However, extension points in most protocol specifications break validation. Extension points are wildcards and considered best practice for loose composition, but they also enable an attacker to add unchecked content in a document, e.g., for a signature wrapping attack.   This paper introduces datatyped XML visibly pushdown automata (dXVPAs) as language representation for mixed-content XML and presents an incremental learner that infers a dXVPA from example documents. The learner generalizes XML types and datatypes in terms of automaton states and transitions, and an inferred dXVPA converges to a good-enough approximation of the true language. The automaton is free from extension points and capable of stream validation, e.g., as an anomaly detector for XML-based protocols. For dealing with adversarial training data, two scenarios of poisoning are considered: a poisoning attack is either uncovered at a later time or remains hidden. Unlearning can therefore remove an identified poisoning attack from a dXVPA, and sanitization trims low-frequent states and transitions to get rid of hidden attacks. All algorithms have been evaluated in four scenarios, including a web service implemented in Apache Axis2 and Apache Rampart, where attacks have been simulated. In all scenarios, the learned automaton had zero false positives and outperformed traditional schema validation."

Each transition rule of a weighted pushdown system is associated with an element of a bounded semiring representing the weight of the rule. However, we have realized that the restriction of the boundedness is too strict and the formulation of weighted pushdown systems is not general enough for some applications. To generalize weighted pushdown systems, we first introduce the notion of stack signatures that summarize the effect of a computation of a pushdown system and formulate pushdown systems as automata over the monoid of stack signatures. We then generalize weighted pushdown systems by introducing semirings indexed by the monoid and weaken the boundedness to local boundedness."

It is based on a novel representation of all plays starting in a non-terminal. The representation uses the domain of Boolean formulas over the transition monoid of the target automaton. The elements of the monoid are essentially procedure summaries, and our approach can be seen as the first summary-based algorithm for the synthesis of recursive programs.

Using reduction to counter machines, we show that the satisfiability problem of AFL is PSPACE-complete, and with a natural restriction the complexity decreases to NP. We also show that adding either universal quantifiers or concatenation leads to undecidability.   AFL contains terms that fold a function over an array. We demonstrate that folding, a well-known concept from functional languages, allows us to concisely summarize loops that count over arrays, which occurs frequently in real-life programs.

In the first one, agents are considered to be fully rational and systems are seen as multi-player games. In the second one, agents are considered to be fully stochastic processes and the system itself is seen as a large stochastic process. From the standpoint of a particular agent - having to choose a strategy, the choice of the paradigm is crucial: the most adequate strategy depends on the assumptions made on the other agents.   In this paper, we focus on two-player games and their application to the automated synthesis of reliable controllers for reactive systems - a field at the crossroads between computer science and mathematics. In this setting, the reactive system to control is a player, and its environment is its opponent, usually assumed to be fully antagonistic or fully stochastic. We illustrate several recent developments aiming to breach this narrow taxonomy by providing formal concepts and mathematical frameworks to reason about richer behavioral models.   The interest of such models is not limited to reactive system synthesis but extends to other application fields of game theory. The goal of our contribution is to give a high-level presentation of key concepts and applications, aimed at a broad audience. To achieve this goal, we illustrate those rich behavioral models on a classical challenge of the everyday life: planning a journey in an uncertain environment."

Finiteness: Are there only finitely many solutions of such an equation? PSPACE algorithms with worse complexities for the first problem are known, but so far, a PSPACE algorithm for the second problem was out of reach.

The predictor masters the emitter if there is a point after which all of the predictor's guesses are correct. In this paper we consider the case in which the predictor is an automaton and the emitted values are drawn from a finite set; i.e., the emitted sequence is an infinite word. We examine the predictive capabilities of finite automata, pushdown automata, stack automata (a generalization of pushdown automata), and multihead finite automata. We relate our predicting automata to purely periodic words, ultimately periodic words, and multilinear words, describing novel prediction algorithms for mastering these sequences."

The package contains a C++ library with algorithms for working with transformation rules in the Double Pushout formalism, e.g., composition of rules and a domain specific language for programming graph language generation. A Python interface makes these features easily accessible. The package also has extensive procedures for automatically visualising not only graphs and rewrite rules, but also Double Pushout diagrams and graph languages in form of directed hypergraphs. The software is available as an open source package, and interactive examples can be found on the accompanying webpage."

We show that Bollig et al.'s session automata, which focus on global freshness, are equivalent to regular nondeterministic nominal automata (RNNA), a natural nominal automaton model with explicit name binding that has appeared implicitly in the semantics of nominal Kleene algebra (NKA), an extension of Kleene algebra with name binding. The expected Kleene theorem for NKA is known to fail in one direction, i.e. there are nominal languages that can be accepted by an RNNA but are not definable in NKA; via session automata, we obtain a full Kleene theorem for RNNAs for an expression language that extends NKA with unscoped name binding. Based on the equivalence with RNNAs, we then slightly rephrase the known equivalence checking algorithm for session automata. Reinterpreting the data language semantics of name binding by unrestricted instead of clean alpha-equivalence, we obtain a local freshness semantics as a quotient of the global freshness semantics. Under local freshness semantics, RNNAs turn out to be equivalent to a natural subclass of Bojanczyk et al.'s nondeterministic orbit-finite automata. We establish decidability of inclusion under local freshness by modifying the RNNA-based algorithm; in summary, we obtain a formalism for local freshness in data languages that is reasonably expressive and has a decidable inclusion problem."

Compositionality means that the behaviour of a compound system relies only on the behaviour of its components, i.e. there is no emergent behaviour. Process equivalence means that the explicit statespace of a system takes a back seat to its interaction patterns: the information that an environment can obtain though interaction.   Petri nets are a classical, yet widely used and understood, model of concurrency. Nevertheless, they have often been described as a non-compositional model, and tools tend to deal with monolithic, globally-specified models.   This tutorial paper concentrates on Petri Nets with Boundaries (PNB): a compositional, graphical algebra of 1-safe nets, and its applications to reachability checking within the tool Penrose. The algorithms feature the use of compositionality and process equivalence, a powerful combination that can be harnessed to improve the performance of checking reachability and coverability in several common examples where Petri nets model realistic concurrent systems."
2016-03-02 11:16:37+00:00,2016-05-05 06:50:56+00:00,"Designing query languages for graph structured data is an active field of research, where expressiveness and efficient algorithms for query evaluation are conflicting goals. To better handle dynamically changing data, recent work has been done on designing query languages that can compare values stored in the graph database, without hard coding the values in the query. The main idea is to allow variables in the query and bind the variables to values when evaluating the query. For query languages that bind variables only once, query evaluation is usually NP-complete. There are query languages that allow binding inside the scope of Kleene star operators, which can themselves be in the scope of bindings and so on. Uncontrolled nesting of binding and iteration within one another results in query evaluation being PSPACE-complete.   We define a way to syntactically control the nesting depth of iterated bindings, and study how this affects expressiveness and efficiency of query evaluation. The result is an infinite, syntactically defined hierarchy of expressions. We prove that the corresponding language hierarchy is strict. Given an expression in the hierarchy, we prove that it is undecidable to check if there is a language equivalent expression at lower levels. We prove that evaluating a query based on an expression at level i can be done in $\Sigma_i$ in the polynomial time hierarchy. Satisfiability of quantified Boolean formulas can be reduced to query evaluation; we study the relationship between alternations in Boolean quantifiers and the depth of nesting of iterated bindings."

Given a DFA $A$ and $k\ge 0$, it is an NL-complete problem to decide whether the language $L(A)$ is piecewise testable and, for $k\ge 4$, it is coNP-complete to decide whether the language $L(A)$ is $k$-piecewise testable. It is known that the depth of the minimal DFA serves as an upper bound on $k$. Namely, if $L(A)$ is piecewise testable, then it is $k$-piecewise testable for $k$ equal to the depth of $A$. In this paper, we show that some form of nondeterminism does not violate this upper bound result. Specifically, we define a class of NFAs, called ptNFAs, that recognize piecewise testable languages and show that the depth of a ptNFA provides an (up to exponentially better) upper bound on $k$ than the minimal DFA. We provide an application of our result, discuss the relationship between $k$-piecewise testability and the depth of NFAs, and study the complexity of $k$-piecewise testability for ptNFAs."

He was interested to characterize those regular languages where the groups in the syntactic monoid belong to a variety $H$. He allowed operations on the language side which are union, intersection, concatenation and modified Kleene-star involving a mapping of a prefix code of bounded synchronization delay to a group $G\in H$, but no complementation. In our notation this leads to the language classes $SD_G(A^\infty)$ and $SD_H(A^\infty$). Our main result shows that $SD_H(A^\infty)$ always corresponds to the languages having syntactic monoids where all subgroups are in $H$. Sch\""utzenberger showed this for a variety $H$ if $H$ contains Abelian groups, only. Our method shows the general result for all $H$ directly on finite and infinite words. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of local Rees products which refers to a simple type of classical Rees extensions. We give a decomposition of a monoid in terms of its groups and local Rees products. This gives a somewhat similar, but simpler decomposition than in Rhodes' synthesis theorem. Moreover, we need a singly exponential number of operations, only. Finally, our decomposition yields an answer to a question in a recent paper of Almeida and Kl\'ima about varieties that are closed under Rees products."

Then, we focus on (a more general problem) separating a pair of two disjoint finite set of words. We show that QFAs can separate them efficiently in nondeterministic acceptance mode, i.e. the number of states is two to the power of the size of the small set. Additionally, we examine affine finite automata (AfAs) and show that two states are enough to separate any pair with zero-error. Moreover, AfAs can separate any pair of disjoint finite sets of words with one-sided bounded error efficiently like QFAs in nondeterministic mode."

The concept of primitive sets of matrices comes up in a number of problems within control theory, non-homogeneous Markov chains, automata theory etc. Recently, connections between synchronizing automata and primitive sets of matrices were established.

We study the maximal exponent among all primitive sets of $n \times n$ matrices, which we denote by $\exp(n)$. We prove that $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \tfrac{\log \exp(n)}{n} = \tfrac{\log 3}{3}$, and moreover, we establish that this bound leads to a resolution of the \v{C}ern\'{y} problem for carefully synchronizing automata. We also study the set of matrices with no zero rows and columns, denoted by $\mathcal{NZ}$, due to its intriguing connections to the \v{C}ern\'{y} conjecture and the recent generalization of Perron-Frobenius theory for this class. We characterize computational complexity of different problems related to the exponent of $\mathcal{NZ}$ matrix sets, and present a quadratic bound on the exponents of sets belonging to a special subclass.

It will show how to expand Jaccard distance, which works on finite sets, to potentially-infinite regular languages. The entropy of a regular language plays a large role in the extension. Much of the paper is spent investigating the entropy of a regular language. This includes addressing issues that have required previous authors to rely on the upper limit of Shannon's traditional formulation of entropy, because its limit does not always exist. The paper also includes proposing a new limit based formulation for the entropy of a regular language and proves that formulation to both exist and be equivalent to Shannon's original formulation (when it exists). Additionally, the proposed formulation is shown to equal an analogous but formally quite different notion of topological entropy from Symbolic Dynamics -- consequently also showing Shannon's original formulation to be equivalent to topological entropy. Surprisingly, the natural Jaccard-like entropy distance is trivial in most cases. Instead, the {\it entropy sum} distance metric is suggested, and shown to be granular in certain situations."

Hence, its language is now a set of words over an infinite alphabet. We show that universality and inclusion for that model are PSPACE-complete, thus no harder than the corresponding problems for finite automata. In fact, by establishing a link with visibly one-counter automata, we show that OCAs with counter observability are effectively determinizable and closed under all boolean operations."

Using it, we are able to derive the following theorems. (1) It is possible to learn by example all of $\Sigma^0_1 \cup \Pi^0_1$ as well as some supersets; (2) in adversarial learning (which we describe as a pursuit-evasion game), the pursuer has a winning strategy (in other words, $\Sigma^0_1$ can be learned adversarially, but $\Pi^0_1$ not); (3) some languages in $\Pi^0_1$ cannot be approximated by any language in $\Sigma^0_1$.

In contrast to this, I show that if $L'_m$ and $L_n$ are over their own different alphabets, the state complexity of union and symmetric difference is $mn+m+n+1$, that of intersection is $mn$, that of difference is $mn+m$, and that of the product is $m2^n+2^{n-1}$."
2016-02-03 16:18:41+00:00,2016-02-03 16:18:41+00:00,"Formal control synthesis approaches over stochastic systems have received significant attention in the past few years, in view of their ability to provide provably correct controllers for complex logical specifications in an automated fashion. Examples of complex specifications of interest include properties expressed as formulae in linear temporal logic (LTL) or as automata on infinite strings. A general methodology to synthesize controllers for such properties resorts to symbolic abstractions of the given stochastic systems. Symbolic models are discrete abstractions of the given concrete systems with the property that a controller designed on the abstraction can be refined (or implemented) into a controller on the original system. Although the recent development of techniques for the construction of symbolic models has been quite encouraging, the general goal of formal synthesis over stochastic control systems is by no means solved. A fundamental issue with the existing techniques is the known ""curse of dimensionality,"" which is due to the need to discretize state and input sets and that results in an exponential complexity over the number of state and input variables in the concrete system. In this work we propose a novel abstraction technique for incrementally stable stochastic control systems, which does not require state-space discretization but only input set discretization, and that can be potentially more efficient (and thus scalable) than existing approaches. We elucidate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by synthesizing a schedule for the coordination of two traffic lights under some safety and fairness requirements for a road traffic model. Further we argue that this 5-dimensional linear stochastic control system cannot be studied with existing approaches based on state-space discretization due to the very large number of generated discrete states."

The correspondence between $\mu$-Calculus and alternating tree automaton is used to solve the satisfiability and model checking problems by compiling the modal $\mu$-Calculus formula into an alternating tree automata. Thus advocating an automaton model specially tailored for working with modal $\mu$-Calculus. The advantage of the automaton model is its ability to deal with arbitrary branching in a much simpler way as compare to the one proposed by Janin and Walukiewicz. Both problems (i.e., model checking and satisfiability) are solved by reduction to the corresponding problems of alternating tree automata, namely to the acceptance and the non-emptiness problems, respectively. These problems, in turn, are solved using parity games where semantics of alternating tree automata is translated to a winning strategy in an appropriate parity game."

They are often used in formal verification and also can serve as visual software models. The latter application is associated with the problems of software synthesis and automatic derivation of software models from specification. Smaller synthesized models are more general and are easier to comprehend, yet the problem of minimum FSM identification has received little attention in previous research.   This paper presents four exact methods to tackle the problem of minimum FSM identification from a set of test scenarios and a temporal specification represented in linear temporal logic. The methods are implemented as an open-source tool. Three of them are based on translations of the FSM identification problem to SAT or QSAT problem instances. Accounting for temporal properties is done via counterexample prohibition. Counterexamples are either obtained from previously identified FSMs, or based on bounded model checking. The fourth method uses backtracking. The proposed methods are evaluated on several case studies and on a larger number of randomly generated instances of increasing complexity. The results show that the Iterative SAT-based method is the leader among the proposed methods. The methods are also compared with existing inexact approaches, i.e. the ones which do not necessarily identify the minimum FSM, and these comparisons show encouraging results."

These are words that in addition to the letters from $A$ may contain an arbitrary number of occurrences of a special `joker' symbol $\Diamond\notin A$, which can be substituted by any symbol from $A$. For example, $u=0\Diamond 011100$ is a linear partial word for the binary alphabet $A=\{0,1\}$ and for $n=3$ (e.g., the first three letters of $u$ yield the subwords $000$ and $010$).

One of the goals of Information Theory is to add redundancy in the transmission of information so that the information is transmitted reliably and the amount of information transmitted through the channel is as large as possible. The maximum rate at which reliable transmission is possible is called the capacity. If the channel does not keep memory of its past, the capacity is given by a simple optimization problem and can be efficiently computed. The situation of channels with memory is less clear. Here we show that for channels with memory the capacity cannot be computed to within precision 1/5. Our result holds even if we consider one of the simplest families of such channels -information-stable finite state machine channels-, restrict the input and output of the channel to 4 and 1 bit respectively and allow 6 bits of memory."

A fundamental problem on this model, with applications in the verification of stochastic systems, is to compute information about the distribution of the total cost accumulated in a run. This includes the probability of large total costs, the median cost, and other quantiles. While expectations can be computed in polynomial time, previous work has demonstrated that the computation of cost quantiles is harder but can be done in PSPACE. In this paper we show that cost quantiles in cost Markov chains can be computed in the counting hierarchy, thus providing evidence that computing those quantiles is likely not PSPACE-hard. We obtain this result by exhibiting a tight link to a problem in formal language theory: counting the number of words that are both accepted by a given automaton and have a given Parikh image. Motivated by this link, we comprehensively investigate the complexity of the latter problem. Among other techniques, we rely on the so-called BEST theorem for efficiently computing the number of Eulerian circuits in a directed graph."

We resort to constructing finite-state controllers for such systems through an automata learning approach, utilizing a symbolic representation of the underlying game that is based on finite automata. Throughout the learning process, the learner maintains an approximation of the winning region (represented as a finite automaton) and refines it using different types of counterexamples provided by the teacher until a satisfactory controller can be derived (if one exists). We present a symbolic representation of safety games (inspired by regular model checking), propose implementations of the learner and teacher, and evaluate their performance on examples motivated by robotic motion planning in dynamic environments."

We test the method to provide evidence in favour of a conjecture concerning the computing capabilities of Busy Beaver Turing machines as candidates for Turing universality. The method has recently been used to quantify the number of 'intrinsically universal' cellular automata, with results that point towards the pervasiveness of universality due to a widespread capacity for emulation. Our method represents an unconventional approach to the classical and seminal concept of Turing universality, and it may be extended and applied in a broader context to natural computation, by (in something like the spirit of the Turing test) observing the behaviour of a system under circumstances where formal proofs of universality are difficult, if not impossible to come by."

We prove that for each context-free language L, there exist an integer K and a homomorphism h such that L=h(D'_K), where D'_K is a subset of the one-sided Dyck language over K letters. Through a transition-like diagram for a context-free grammar in Dyck normal form, we effectively build a regular language R that satisfies the Chomsky-Schutzenberger theorem. Using graphical approaches we refine R such that the Chomsky-Schutzenberger theorem still holds. Based on this readjustment we sketch a transition diagram for a regular grammar that generates a regular superset approximation for the initial context-free language."

Namely, given a parametric specification with multiple parameters, our solution can automatically infer the ranges of parameters for which the property does not hold on the system. In this paper, we consider parametric specifications in Metric or Signal Temporal Logic (MTL or STL). Using robust semantics for MTL, the parameter mining problem can be converted into a Pareto optimization problem for which we can provide an approximate solution by utilizing stochastic optimization methods.

Despite these results, we show by giving a parameterized family that there is a proper hierarchy in $k$-block deterministic regular languages. We also prove that there is a proper hierarchy in $k$-lookahead deterministic regular languages by studying particular properties of unary regular expressions.

In this paper, detailed proofs of our central results announced at LICS'16 are presented, together with topos-theoretic considerations. The main results include (I) a proof of the duality theorem between profinite monoids and semi-galois categories, extending the duality theorem between profinite groups and galois categories; based on this results on semi-galois categories, we then discuss (II) a reinterpretation of Eilenberg's theory from a viewpoint of duality theorem; in relation with this reinterpretation of the theory, (III) we also give a purely topos-theoretic characterization of classifying topoi BM of profinite monoids M among general coherent topoi, which is a topos-theoretic application of (I). This characterization states that a topos E is equivalent to the classifying topos BM of some profinite monoid M if and only if E is (i) coherent, (ii) noetherian, and (iii) has a surjective coherent point.

Using a result of Akiyama-Komornik and Feng, this implies that $Z_{\beta, M}$ is recognizable by a finite B\""uchi automaton for any positive integer $M \ge \lceil \beta \rceil -1$ if and only if $\beta$ is a Pisot number. This improves the previous bound $M \ge \lceil \beta \rceil $.   For the second application the base and the digits are complex. We consider the on-line algorithm for division of Trivedi and Ercegovac generalized to a complex numeration system. In on-line arithmetic the operands and results are processed in a digit serial manner, starting with the most significant digit. The divisor must be far from $0$, which means that no prefix of the $(\beta,A)$-representation of the divisor can be small. The numeration system $(\beta,A)$ is said to \emph{allow preprocessing} if there exists a finite list of transformations on the divisor which achieve this task. We show that $(\beta,A )$ allows preprocessing if and only if the spectrum $S_{{A}}(\beta)$ has no accumulation point."

Sufficient conditions to achieve the centralized optimal solution are discussed. Our approach can be used for both prefix-closed and non-prefix-closed specifications."

First, we show how to use a Monte-Carlo approach to uniformly sample a NFA. Secondly, we show how to use the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm to uniformly generate NFAs up to isomorphism. Using labeling techniques, we show that in practice it is possible to move into the modified Markov Chain efficiently, allowing the random generation of NFAs up to isomorphism with dozens of states. This general approach is also applied to several interesting subclasses of NFAs (up to isomorphism), such as NFAs having a unique initial states and a bounded output degree. Finally, we prove that for these interesting subclasses of NFAs, moving into the Metropolis Markov chain can be done in polynomial time. Promising experimental results constitute a practical contribution."

We consider next the problem of recognizing Engel elements, namely elements $y$ such that the map $x\mapsto[x,y]$ attracts to $\{1\}$.

We also state partial results about the tightness of this bound. We show that there exist witness languages meeting the bound if $2\le m\le 5$ and $n\ge2$, and also if $m=n=6$. Moreover, we prove that in the subset automaton of the NFA accepting the shuffle, all $2^{mn}$ states can be distinguishable, and an alphabet of size three suffices for that. It follows that the bound can be met if all $f(m,n)$ states are reachable. We know that an alphabet of size at least $mn$ is required provided that $m,n \ge 2$. The question of reachability, and hence also of the tightness of the bound $f(m,n)$ in general, remains open."

Moreover, we give such word sets of asymptotically optimal length. Similar results are obtained for a commonly used subclass of glue functions."

It is known that this problem is solvable in triply-exponential time, but not whether it can be done in doubly-exponential time, i.e., whether it is just as hard as solving LTL realizability.   We take a step towards resolving this problem by showing that the optimum can be approximated within a factor of two in doubly-exponential time. Also, we report on a proof-of-concept implementation of the algorithm based on bounded LTL synthesis, which computes the smallest implementation of a given specification. In our experiments, we observe a tradeoff between the size of the implementation and the bound it realizes. We investigate this tradeoff in the general case and prove upper bounds, which reduce the search space for the algorithm, and matching lower bounds."

Generalizing a previous result, we produce a new family of regular languages on a two-letter alphabet having arbitrary high genus. Let $L$ be a regular language. In order to understand the genus $g(L)$ of $L$, we introduce the topological size of $|L|_{\rm{top}}$ to be the minimal size of all finite deterministic automata of genus $g(L)$ computing $L$. We show that the minimal finite deterministic automaton of a regular language can be arbitrary far away from a finite deterministic automaton realizing the minimal genus and computing the same language, both in terms of the difference of genera and in terms of the difference in size. In particular, we show that the topological size $|L|_{\rm{top}}$ can grow at least exponentially in size $|L|$. We conjecture however the genus of every regular language to be computable. This conjecture implies in particular that the planarity of a regular language is decidable, a question asked in 1976 by R.V. Book and A.K. Chandra. We prove here the conjecture for a fairly generic class of regular languages having no short cycles."

An automaton is called synchronizing if there exists a word which sends all states of the automaton to a single state. In the present paper we study connections between spectral and synchronizing properties of digraphs. We show that if a coloring of a digraph is not synchronizing, then the stationary distribution of an associated Markov chain has a partition of coordinates into blocks of equal sum. Moreover, if there exists such a partition, then there exists a non-synchronizing automaton with such stationary distribution. We extend these results to bound the number of non-synchronizing colorings for digraphs with particular eigenvectors. We also demonstrate that the length of the shortest synchronizing word of any coloring is at most $w^2 - 3w + 3$, where $w$ is the sum of the coordinates of the integer principal eigenvector of the digraph."

Correctness of an implementation object is defined in terms of a corresponding abstract specification. This gives rise to two important verification questions: membership (checking whether a behaviour of the implementation is allowed by the specification) and correctness (checking whether all behaviours of the implementation are allowed by the specification). In this paper, we show that the membership problem for quiescent consistency is NP-complete and that the correctness problem is decidable, but coNP-hard and in EXPSPACE. For both problems, we consider restricted versions of quiescent consistency by assuming an upper limit on the number of events between two quiescent points. Here, we show that the membership problem is in PTIME, whereas correctness is in PSPACE.   Quiescent consistency does not guarantee sequential consistency, i.e., it allows operation calls by the same process to be reordered when mapping to an abstract specification. Therefore, we also consider quiescent sequential consistency, which strengthens quiescent consistency with an additional sequential consistency condition. We show that the unrestricted versions of membership and correctness are NP-complete and undecidable, respectively. When by placing a limit on the number of events between two quiescent points, membership is in PTIME, while correctness is in PSPACE. Finally, we consider a version of quiescent sequential consistency that places an upper limit on the number of processes for every run of the implementation, and show that the membership problem for quiescent sequential consistency with this restriction is in PTIME."

If we add to a parser the possibility to manipulate a directed graph of size $O(|G|n)$ where $n$ is the length of the input then we obtain an extended parser. The graph is used for an efficient parallel simulation of all potential leftmost derivations of the current right sentential form such that the unique rightmost derivation of the input can be computed. Given an arbitrary $LR(k)$-grammar $G$, we show how to construct an extended parser of $O(|G| + \#LA |N|2^k k \log k)$ size where $|N|$ is the number of nonterminal symbols and $\#LA$ is the number of relevant lookaheads with respect to the grammar $G$. As the usual parser, this extended parser uses only tables as data structure. Using some ingenious data structures and increasing the parsing time by a small constant factor, the size of the extended parser can be reduced to $O(|G| + \#LA|N|k^2)$. The parsing time is $O(ld(input) + k|G|n)$ where $ld(input)$ is the length of the derivation of the input. Moreover, we have constructed a one pass parser."

It is an extension of B\""uchi automaton by using a set of records as its alphabet or transition labels. Records are used to express the synchrony between the externally visible actions of coordinated components modeled by BARs. The main composition operator on the set of BARs is called as join which is the semantics of its counterpart in Reo. In this paper, we define the notion of labeled transition systems of records as a generalization of the notion of BAR, abstracting away from acceptance or rejection of strings. Then, we consider four equivalence relations (semantics) over the set of labeled transition systems of records and investigate their congruency with respect to the join composition operator. In fact, we prove that the finite-traces-based, infinite-traces-based, and nondeterministic finite automata (NFA)-based equivalence relations all are congruence relations over the set of all labeled transition systems of records with respect to the join operation. However, the equivalence relation using B\""uchi acceptance condition is not so. In addition, using these results, we introduce the language-theoretic definitions of the join operation considering both finite and infinite strings notions. Also, we show that there is no language-based and structure-independent definition of the join operation on B\""uchi automata of records."

In this paper we develop an algorithm for determinisation and completion of finite tree automata, whose worst-case complexity remains unchanged, but which performs far better than existing algorithms in practice. The critical aspect of the algorithm is that the transitions of the determinised (and possibly completed) automaton are generated in a potentially very compact form called product form, which can reduce the size of the representation dramatically. Furthermore, the representation can often be used directly when manipulating the determinised automaton. The paper contains an experimental evaluation of the algorithm on a large set of tree automata examples."

The most fundamental gate is a ""toppler"", which absorbs input particles until their number exceeds some given threshold, at which point it topples, emitting one particle and returning to its initial state. With the exception of an adder gate, which simply combines two streams of particles, each of our gates has only one input wire.

The \emph{subsequence automaton} of $S$ (often called the \emph{directed acyclic subsequence graph}) is the minimal deterministic finite automaton accepting all subsequences of $S$. A straightforward construction shows that the size (number of states and transitions) of the subsequence automaton is $O(n\sigma)$ and that this bound is asymptotically optimal.   In this paper, we consider subsequence automata with \emph{default transitions}, that is, special transitions to be taken only if none of the regular transitions match the current character, and which do not consume the current character. We show that with default transitions, much smaller subsequence automata are possible, and provide a full trade-off between the size of the automaton and the \emph{delay}, i.e., the maximum number of consecutive default transitions followed before consuming a character.   Specifically, given any integer parameter $k$, $1 < k \leq \sigma$, we present a subsequence automaton with default transitions of size $O(nk\log_{k}\sigma)$ and delay $O(\log_k \sigma)$. Hence, with $k = 2$ we obtain an automaton of size $O(n \log \sigma)$ and delay $O(\log \sigma)$. On the other extreme, with $k = \sigma$, we obtain an automaton of size $O(n \sigma)$ and delay $O(1)$, thus matching the bound for the standard subsequence automaton construction. Finally, we generalize the result to multiple strings. The key component of our result is a novel hierarchical automata construction of independent interest."

It turns out that self-similar $2$-automatic sequences (viewed up to a permutation of their alphabet) are in bijection with many interesting objects, for example dessins d'enfants (covers of the Riemann sphere with three points removed).   For any $p$ we show that, in the case of an automatic sequence produced ""by a Cayley graph"", the group and indeed the automaton can be recovered canonically from the sequence.   Further, we show that a rational fraction may be associated to any automatic sequence. To compute this fraction explicitly, knowledge of a certain graph is required.

Trees are labeled with symbols from two alphabets, an unranked operator alphabet and an alphabet used for leaves only. Syntactic algebras of unranked tree languages are defined similarly as for ranked tree languages, and an unranked tree language is shown to be recognizable iff its syntactic algebra is regular, i.e., a finite unranked algebra in which the operations are defined by regular languages over its set of elements. We establish a bijective correspondence between varieties of unranked tree languages and varieties of regular algebras. For this, we develop a basic theory of unranked algebras in which algebras over all operator alphabets are considered together. Finally, we show that the natural unranked counterparts of several general varieties of ranked tree languages form varieties in our sense.   This work parallels closely the theory of general varieties of ranked tree languages and general varieties of finite algebras, but many nontrivial modifications are required. For example, principal varieties as the basic building blocks of varieties of tree languages have to be replaced by what we call quasi-principal varieties, and we device a general scheme for defining these by certain systems of congruences."

However, its high EXPSPACE-complete complexity poses a challenge when encountered in real-world instances. In this paper, we develop a new approach to this problem which is primarily based on applying forward coverability in continuous Petri nets as a pruning criterion inside a backward coverability framework. A cornerstone of our approach is the efficient encoding of a recently developed polynomial-time algorithm for reachability in continuous Petri nets into SMT. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on standard benchmarks from the literature, which shows that our approach decides significantly more instances than any existing tool and is in addition often much faster, in particular on large instances."

A hybrid automata (HA) is a well known and widely used formal model for the specification of such systems. While many methods exist for simulating hybrid automata, there are no known approaches for the automatic code generation from HA that are semantic preserving. If this were feasible, it would enable the design of a plant-on-a-chip (PoC) system that could be used for the emulation of the plant to validate discrete controllers. Such an approach would need to be mathematically sound and should not rely on numerical solvers. We propose a method of PoC design for plant emulation, not possible before. The approach restricts input/output (I/O) HA models using a set of criteria for well-formedness which are statically verified. Following verification, we use an abstraction based on a synchronous approach to facilitate code generation. This is feasible through a sound transformation to synchronous HA. We compare our method (the developed tool called Piha) to the widely used Simulink R simulation framework and show that our method is superior in both execution time and code size. Our approach to the PoC problem paves the way for the emulation of physical plants in diverse domains such as robotics, automation, medical devices, and intelligent transportation systems."

However, many computational problems for matrix semigroups are inherently difficult to solve even for problems in low dimensions and most matrix semigroup problems become undecidable in general starting from dimension three or four.   This paper solves two open problems about the decidability of the vector reachability problem over a finitely generated semigroup of matrices from $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ and the point to point reachability (over rational numbers) for fractional linear transformations, where associated matrices are from $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$. The approach to solving reachability problems is based on the characterization of reachability paths between points which is followed by the translation of numerical problems on matrices into computational and combinatorial problems on words and formal languages. We also give a geometric interpretation of reachability paths and extend the decidability results to matrix products represented by arbitrary labelled directed graphs. Finally, we will use this technique to prove that a special case of the scalar reachability problem is decidable."

Our model of computations is the word-RAM, in which basic arithmetic operations on (large) numbers of size at most {\sigma}^n take O(n) time. Our algorithm for ranking Lyndon words makes O(n^2) arithmetic operations (this would imply directly cubic time on word-RAM).

Our approach yields a novel perspective on the complexity, controllability, causality and (re)programmability discrete dynamical systems. We find evidence that the density of (qualitatively different) computer programs that can be reprogrammed grows asymptotically as a function of program and compiler size. To illustrate these findings we show a series of behavioural boundary crossing results, including emulations (for all initial conditions) of Wolfram class 2 Elementary Cellular Automata (ECA) by Class 1 ECA, emulations of Classes 1, 2 and 3 ECA by Class 2 and 3 ECA, and of Classes 1, 2 and 3 by Class 3 ECA, along with results of even greater emulability for general CA (neighbourhood $r=3/2$), including Class 1 CA emulating Classes 2 and 3, and Classes 3 and 4 emulating all other classes (1, 2, 3 and 4). The emulations occur with only a linear overhead and can be considered computationally efficient. We also found that there is no hacking strategy to compress the search space based on compiler profiling in terms of e.g. similarity or complexity, suggesting that no strategy other than exhaustive search is viable. We also introduce emulation networks, derive a topologically-based measure of complexity based upon out- and in-degree connectivity, and establish bridges to fundamental ideas of complexity, universality, causality and dynamical systems."

First, by comparing the behaviour of a system with the expected one, or by checking if such system satisfies some security requirements: we investigate a novel approximate behavioural-equivalence for comparing processes behaviour, thus extending the Generalised Non Deducibility on Composition (GNDC) approach with scores. As a second result, we equip a modal logic with semiring values with the purpose to have a weight related to the satisfaction of a formula that specifies some requested property.

The smallest number of edges in a rectifier network computing $M$ is a classic complexity measure on matrices, which has been studied for more than half a century.   We explore two well-known techniques that have hitherto found little to no applications in this theory. Both of them build on a basic fact that depth-$2$ rectifier networks are essentially weighted coverings of Boolean matrices with rectangles. We obtain new results by using fractional and greedy coverings (defined in the standard way).   First, we show that all fractional coverings of the so-called full triangular matrix have cost at least $n\log n$. This provides (a fortiori) a new proof of the tight lower bound on its depth-$2$ complexity (the exact value has been known since 1965, but previous proofs are based on different arguments). Second, we show that the greedy heuristic is instrumental in tightening the upper bound on the depth-$2$ complexity of the Kneser-Sierpi\'nski (disjointness) matrix. The previous upper bound is $O(n^{1.28})$, and we improve it to $O(n^{1.17})$, while the best known lower bound is $\Omega(n^{1.16})$. Third, using fractional coverings, we obtain a form of direct product theorem that gives a lower bound on unbounded-depth complexity of Kronecker (tensor) products of matrices. In this case, the greedy heuristic shows (by an argument due to Lov\'asz) that our result is only a logarithmic factor away from the ""full"" direct product theorem.

It is decidable whether the delaying player is able to win such a game with bounded lookahead, i.e., if she only skips a finite number of moves.   However, bounded lookahead is not always sufficient: we present a game that can be won with unbounded lookahead, but not with bounded lookahead. Then, we consider WMSO+U delay games with unbounded lookahead and show that the exact evolution of the lookahead is irrelevant: the winner is always the same, as long as the initial lookahead is large enough and the lookahead tends to infinity."

We study average-energy games, where the goal is to optimize the long-run average of the accumulated energy.

We define a model of non-deterministic, 2-way, concurrent automata working on series-parallel graphs and communicating through shared registers on the nodes of the graph. We consider the following verification problem: given a family of series-parallel graphs described by a context-free graph transformation system (GTS), and a concurrent automaton over series-parallel graphs, is some graph generated by the GTS accepted by the automaton? The general problem is undecidable already for (one-way) multi-head automata over strings. We show that a bounded version, where the automata make a fixed number of reversals along the graph and use a fixed number of shared registers is decidable, even though there is no bound on the sizes of series-parallel graphs generated by the GTS. Our decidability result is based on establishing that the number of context switches is bounded and on an encoding of the computation of bounded concurrent automata to reduce the emptiness problem to the emptiness problem for pushdown automata."

This paper is on the membership problem for a fragment of first-order logic over infinite words; the membership problem asks for a given language whether it is definable in some fixed fragment. The alphabetic topology was introduced as part of an effective characterization of the fragment $\Sigma_2$ over infinite words. Here, $\Sigma_2$ consists of the first-order formulas with two blocks of quantifiers, starting with an existential quantifier. Its Boolean closure is $\mathbb{B}\Sigma_2$. Our first main result is an effective characterization of the Boolean closure of the alphabetic topology, that is, given an $\omega$-regular language $L$, it is decidable whether $L$ is a Boolean combination of open sets in the alphabetic topology. This is then used for transferring Place and Zeitoun's recent decidability result for $\mathbb{B}\Sigma_2$ from finite to infinite words."

The syntactic complexity of a regular language is the cardinality of its syntactic semigroup. The syntactic complexity of a subclass of regular languages is the worst-case syntactic complexity taken as a function of the state complexity $n$ of languages in that class. We prove that $n^{n-1}$, $n^{n-1}+n-1$, and $n^{n-2}+(n-2)2^{n-2}+1$ are tight upper bounds on the syntactic complexities of right ideals and prefix-closed languages, left ideals and suffix-closed languages, and two-sided ideals and factor-closed languages, respectively. Moreover, we show that the transition semigroups meeting the upper bounds for all three types of ideals are unique, and the numbers of generators (4, 5, and 6, respectively) cannot be reduced."
2015-09-20 17:33:13+00:00,2015-09-20 17:33:13+00:00,"The majority of the human genome consists of repeated sequences. An important type of repeated sequences common in the human genome are tandem repeats, where identical copies appear next to each other. For example, in the sequence $AGTC\underline{TGTG}C$, $TGTG$ is a tandem repeat, that may be generated from $AGTCTGC$ by a tandem duplication of length $2$. In this work, we investigate the possibility of generating a large number of sequences from a \textit{seed}, i.e.\ a small initial string, by tandem duplications of bounded length. We study the capacity of such a system, a notion that quantifies the system's generating power. Our results include \textit{exact capacity} values for certain tandem duplication string systems. In addition, motivated by the role of DNA sequences in expressing proteins via RNA and the genetic code, we define the notion of the \textit{expressiveness} of a tandem duplication system as the capability of expressing arbitrary substrings. We then \textit{completely} characterize the expressiveness of tandem duplication systems for general alphabet sizes and duplication lengths. In particular, based on a celebrated result by Axel Thue from 1906, presenting a construction for ternary square-free sequences, we show that for alphabets of size 4 or larger, bounded tandem duplication systems, regardless of the seed and the bound on duplication length, are not fully expressive, i.e. they cannot generate all strings even as substrings of other strings. Note that the alphabet of size 4 is of particular interest as it pertains to the genomic alphabet. Building on this result, we also show that these systems do not have full capacity. In general, our results illustrate that duplication lengths play a more significant role than the seed in generating a large number of sequences for these systems."

The effects of different forms of advice on the succinctness of the advised machines are examined.

For a closely related notion of maximal $\delta$-subrepetition (maximal factors of exponent between $1+\delta$ and $2$), our result implies the $O(n/\delta)$ bound on their number, which improves the bound of (Kolpakov et al., 2010) by a $\log n$ factor.   We also prove an algorithmic time bound $O(\alpha n+S)$ ($S$ size of the output) for computing all maximal $\alpha$-gapped repeats. Our solution, inspired by (Gawrychowski and Manea, 2015), is different from the recently published proof by (Tanimura et al., 2015) of the same bound.

As a consequence, timed automata are in general non-determinizable. This is unfortunate since deterministic automata play a major role in model-based testing, observability and implementability. However, by bounding the length of the traces in the automaton, effective determinization becomes possible. We propose a novel procedure for bounded determinization of timed automata. The procedure unfolds the automata to bounded trees, removes all silent transitions and determinizes via disjunction of guards. The proposed algorithms are optimized to the bounded setting and thus are more efficient and can handle a larger class of timed automata than the general algorithms. The approach is implemented in a prototype tool and evaluated on several examples. To our best knowledge, this is the first implementation of this type of procedure for timed automata."

However, this verification is facing severe challenges. First, in realistic settings, the computing entities only have imperfectly synchronized clocks. A proper timing model is essential to the interpretation of the trace of system execution. Second, the specification should be able to express properties with real-time constraints despite the asynchrony, and the semantics should be interpreted over the currently-observed and continuously-growing trace. To address these challenges, we propose PARO - the partially synchronous system observation framework, which i) adopts the partially synchronous model of time, and introduces the lattice and the timed automata theories to model the trace of system execution; ii) adopts a tailored subset of TCTL to specify temporal properties, and defines the 3-valued semantics to interpret the properties over the currently-observed finite trace; iii) constructs the timed automaton corresponding to the trace at runtime, and reduces the satisfaction of the 3-valued semantics over finite traces to that of the classical boolean semantics over infinite traces.

Furthermore, for $d=2$ deterministic limited automata are equivalent to deterministic pushdown automata, namely they characterize deterministic context-free languages. Further restricting the possible operations, we consider strongly limited automata. These models still characterize context-free languages.

Priced timed games are known to be undecidable for timed automata with $3$ or more clocks, while they are known to be decidable for automata with $1$ clock.   In an attempt to recover decidability for priced timed games Bouyer, Markey, and Sankur studied robust priced timed games where the environment has the power to slightly perturb delays proposed by the controller. Unfortunately, however, they showed that the natural problem of deciding the existence of optimal limit-strategy---optimal strategy of the controller where the perturbations tend to vanish in the limit---is undecidable with $10$ or more clocks. In this paper we revisit this problem and improve our understanding of the decidability of these games. We show that the limit-strategy problem is already undecidable for a subclass of robust priced timed games with $5$ or more clocks.

We show that this introduction of non-determinism increases the computational power of 1-way Quantum finite automata significantly. We establish that Watson-Crick quantum finite automata can accept all regular languages and that it also accepts some languages not accepted by any multihead deterministic finite automata.

We consider the problem of distinguishing two given HMCs based on an observation sequence that one of the HMCs generates. More precisely, given two HMCs and an observation sequence, a distinguishing algorithm is expected to identify the HMC that generates the observation sequence. Two HMCs are called distinguishable if for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a distinguishing algorithm whose error probability is less than $\varepsilon$. We show that one can decide in polynomial time whether two HMCs are distinguishable. Further, we present and analyze two distinguishing algorithms for distinguishable HMCs. The first algorithm makes a decision after processing a fixed number of observations, and it exhibits two-sided error. The second algorithm processes an unbounded number of observations, but the algorithm has only one-sided error. The error probability, for both algorithms, decays exponentially with the number of processed observations. We also provide an algorithm for distinguishing multiple HMCs. Finally, we discuss an application in stochastic runtime verification."

Sometimes a~monitor can be used, that checks a given property on the underlying system at runtime. A monitor for a property $L$ is a deterministic finite automaton $M_L$ that after each finite execution tells whether (1) every possible extension of the execution is in $L$, or (2) every possible extension is in the complement of $L$, or neither (1) nor (2) holds. Moreover, $L$ being monitorable means that it is always possible that in some future the monitor reaches (1) or (2). Classical examples for monitorable properties are safety and cosafety properties. On the other hand, deterministic liveness properties like ""infinitely many $a$'s"" are not monitorable. We discuss various monitor constructions with a focus on deterministic omega-regular languages. We locate a proper subclass of of deterministic omega-regular languages but also strictly large than the subclass of languages which are deterministic and codeterministic, and for this subclass there exists a canonical monitor which also accepts the language itself.   We also address the problem to decide monitorability in comparison with deciding liveness. The state of the art is as follows. Given a B\""uchi automaton, it is PSPACE-complete to decide liveness or monitorability. Given an LTL formula, deciding liveness becomes EXPSPACE-complete, but the complexity to decide monitorability remains open."

Our method works by iterating a max-min operator that has been used before for the embedding problem for properties defined by length-increasing-and-transitive binary relations. By going to order-decreasing rational relations, represented by input-decreasing transducers, we are able to include many known properties from both the noiseless and noisy domains of coding theory, as well as any combination of such properties.

Experiments show that the combination of the two approaches gives optimal search order on standard benchmarks except for one example. This suggests that it should be used instead of the standard BFS algorithm for reachability analysis of timed automata."

In this paper we consider word functions that are definable by one-way transducers (rational functions).

We also introduce a weighted extension of relative distance logic developed by Wilke, and we show that our weighted relative distance logic and WTA are equally expressive. The proof of this result can be derived from our Nivat theorem and Wilke's theorem for relative distance logic. Since the proof of our Nivat theorem is constructive, the translation process from logic to automata and vice versa is also constructive.

In order to define complexity for linear automata, we have to use three operations, namely, triangular product of linear automata, wreath product of pure automata and wreath product of a linear automaton with a pure one which returns a linear automaton. We define the complexity of a linear automaton as the minimal number of operations in the decompositions of the automaton into indecomposable components (atoms). This theory relies on the following parallelism between wreath and triangular products: both of them are terminal objects in the categories of cascade connections of automata.

In this article, we focus on the complementary idea: how two sequences can be efficiently compared based on information that does not occur in the sequences. A word is an {\em absent word} of some sequence if it does not occur in the sequence. An absent word is {\em minimal} if all its proper factors occur in the sequence.

We improve on this result by studying the maximum exponents of abelian powers and abelian repetitions (an abelian repetition is an analogue of a fractional power) in Sturmian words. We give a formula for computing the maximum exponent of an abelian power of abelian period $m$ starting at a given position in any Sturmian word of rotation angle $\alpha$. vAs an analogue of the critical exponent, we introduce the abelian critical exponent $A(s_\alpha)$ of a Sturmian word $s_\alpha$ of angle $\alpha$ as the quantity $A(s_\alpha) = limsup\ k_{m}/m=limsup\ k'_{m}/m$, where $k_{m}$ (resp. $k'_{m}$) denotes the maximum exponent of an abelian power (resp.~of an abelian repetition) of abelian period $m$ (the superior limits coincide for Sturmian words). We show that $A(s_\alpha)$ equals the Lagrange constant of the number $\alpha$. This yields a formula for computing $A(s_\alpha)$ in terms of the partial quotients of the continued fraction expansion of $\alpha$. Using this formula, we prove that $A(s_\alpha) \geq \sqrt{5}$ and that the equality holds for the Fibonacci word. We further prove that $A(s_\alpha)$ is finite if and only if $\alpha$ has bounded partial quotients, that is, if and only if $s_{\alpha}$ is $\beta$-power-free for some real number $\beta$.

At the same time it is a very promising approach, since concurrent programs are difficult to get right, or to analyze with traditional verification techniques. This paper gives an introduction to distributed synthesis in the setting of Mazurkiewicz traces, and its applications to decentralized runtime monitoring. 1 Context Modern computing systems are increasingly distributed and heterogeneous. Software needs to be able to exploit these advances, providing means for applications to be more performant. Traditional concurrent programming paradigms, as in Java, are based on threads, shared-memory, and locking mechanisms that guard access to common data. More recent paradigms like the reactive programming model of Erlang [4] and Scala [35,36] replace shared memory by asynchronous message passing, where sending a message is non-blocking. In all these concurrent frameworks, writing reliable software is a serious challenge. Programmers tend to think about code mostly in a sequential way, and it is hard to grasp all possible schedulings of events in a concurrent execution. For similar reasons, verification and analysis of concurrent programs is a difficult task. Testing, which is still the main method for error detection in software, has low coverage for concurrent programs. The reason is that bugs in such programs are difficult to reproduce: they may happen under very specific thread schedules and the likelihood of taking such corner-case schedules is very low. Automated verification, such as model-checking and other traditional exploration techniques, can handle very limited instances of concurrent programs, mostly because of the very large number of possible states and of possible interleavings of executions. Formal analysis of programs requires as a prerequisite a clean mathematical model for programs. Verification of sequential programs starts usually with an abstraction step -- reducing the value domains of variables to finite domains, viewing conditional branching as non-determinism, etc. Another major simplification consists in disallowing recursion. This leads to a very robust computational model, namely finite-state automata and regular languages. Regular languages of words (and trees) are particularly well understood notions. The deep connections between logic and automata revealed by the foundational work of B\""uchi, Rabin, and others, are the main ingredients in automata-based verification ."

In this paper, we discuss ""topological abstraction"" of higher-dimensional automata, i.e., the replacement of HDAs by smaller ones that can be considered equivalent from both a computer scientific and a topological point of view. By definition, topological abstraction preserves the homotopy type, the trace category, and the homology graph of an HDA. We establish conditions under which cube collapses yield topological abstractions of HDAs."

These questions are known as, respectively, the non-deterministic, alternating, and weak Rabin-Mostowski index problems. Whether they can be answered effectively is a long-standing open problem, solved so far only for languages recognizable by deterministic automata (the alternating variant trivializes).   We investigate a wider class of regular languages, recognizable by so-called game automata, which can be seen as the closure of deterministic ones under complementation and composition. Game automata are known to recognize languages arbitrarily high in the alternating Rabin-Mostowski index hierarchy; that is, the alternating index problem does not trivialize any more.   Our main contribution is that all three index problems are decidable for languages recognizable by game automata. Additionally, we show that it is decidable whether a given regular language can be recognized by a game automaton."
2015-06-03 12:48:02+00:00,2015-06-03 12:48:02+00:00,"We present the first study of robustness of systems that are both timed as well as reactive (I/O). We study the behavior of such timed I/O systems in the presence of ""uncertain inputs"" and formalize their robustness using the analytic notion of Lipschitz continuity. Thus, a timed I/O system is K-(Lipschitz) robust if the perturbation in its output is at most K times the perturbation in its input. We quantify input and output perturbation using ""similarity functions"" over timed words such as the timed version of the Manhattan distance and the Skorokhod distance. We consider two models of timed I/O systems --- timed transducers and asynchronous sequential circuits. While K-robustness is undecidable even for discrete transducers, we identify a class of timed transducers which admits a polynomial space decision procedure for K-robustness. For asynchronous sequential circuits, we reduce K-robustness w.r.t. timed Manhattan distances to K-robusness of discrete letter-to-letter transducers and show PSPACE-compeleteness of the problem."
2015-06-02 14:22:52+00:00,2015-10-12 12:00:13+00:00,"In analogy to Brownian computers we explicitly show how to construct stochastic models, which mimic the behaviour of a general purpose computer (a Turing machine). Our models are discrete state systems obeying a Markovian master equation, which are logically reversible and have a well-defined and consistent thermodynamic interpretation. The resulting master equation, which describes a simple one-step process on an enormously large state space, allows us to thoroughly investigate the thermodynamics of computation for this situation. Especially, in the stationary regime we can well approximate the master equation by a simple Fokker-Planck equation in one dimension. We then show that the entropy production rate at steady state can be made arbitrarily small, but the total (integrated) entropy production is finite and grows logarithmically with the number of computational steps."

An initial study of this partial order of degrees was carried out in (Endrullis, Hendriks, Klop, 2011), but many basic questions remain unanswered. One of the central questions concerns the existence of atom degrees, other than the degree of the `identity sequence' 1 0^0 1 0^1 1 0^2 1 0^3 .... A degree is called an `atom' if below it there is only the bottom degree 0, which consists of the ultimately periodic sequences. We show that also the degree of the `squares sequence' 1 0^0 1 0^1 1 0^4 1 0^9 1 0^{16} ... is an atom. As the main tool for this result we characterise the transducts of `spiralling' sequences and their degrees. We use this to show that every transduct of a `polynomial sequence' either is in 0 or can be transduced back to a polynomial sequence for a polynomial of the same order."
2015-06-01 21:32:37+00:00,2016-07-29 00:58:38+00:00,"In this paper we introduce the \emph{robust random number generation} problem where the goal is to design an abstract tile assembly system (aTAM system) whose terminal assemblies can be split into $n$ partitions such that a resulting assembly of the system lies within each partition with probability 1/$n$, regardless of the relative concentration assignment of the tile types in the system. First, we show this is possible for $n=2$ (a \emph{robust fair coin flip}) within the aTAM, and that such systems guarantee a worst case $\mathcal{O}(1)$ space usage. We accompany our primary construction with variants that show trade-offs in space complexity, initial seed size, temperature, tile complexity, bias, and extensibility, and also prove some negative results. As an application, we combine our coin-flip system with a result of Chandran, Gopalkrishnan, and Reif to show that for any positive integer $n$, there exists a $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ tile system that assembles a constant-width linear assembly of expected length $n$ for any concentration assignment. We then extend our robust fair coin flip result to solve the problem of robust random number generation in the aTAM for all $n$. Two variants of robust random bit generation solutions are presented: an unbounded space solution and a bounded space solution which incurs a small bias. Further, we consider the harder scenario where tile concentrations change arbitrarily at each assembly step and show that while this is not possible in the aTAM, the problem can be solved by exotic tile assembly models from the literature."

We define a generic model where transitions are labeled by elements of a finite partition of the alphabet. We then extend Angluin's L* algorithm for learning regular languages from examples for such automata. We have implemented this algorithm and we demonstrate its behavior where the alphabet is a subset of the natural or real numbers.

Although groups in the latter two classes all satisfy the homological finiteness condition $FP_\infty$, we show that the class of autostackable groups includes a group that is not of type $FP_3$.

We study this number of factors, $E(n,k)$, in detail, showing that the limit $\lim_{n\to\infty}E(n,k)/\sqrt{n}$ does not exist for any $k\ge2$, $\liminf_{n\to\infty}E(n,k)/\sqrt{n}=\Theta(1)$, and $\limsup_{n\to\infty}E(n,k)/\sqrt{n}=\Theta(\sqrt{k})$. Such a complicated behaviour stems from the asymmetry between the palindromes of even and odd length. We show that a similar, but much simpler, result on the expected number of squares in random words holds. We also provide some experimental data on the number of palindromic factors in random words."

Alur et al. and Kupferman et al. showed that this is the case for Parametric LTL (PLTL) and PROMPT-LTL respectively, which have temporal operators equipped with variables that bound their scope in time. Later, this was also shown to be true for Parametric LDL (PLDL), which extends PLTL to be able to express all omega-regular properties.   Here, we generalize PLTL to systems with costs, i.e., we do not bound the scope of operators in time, but bound the scope in terms of the cost accumulated during time. Again, we show that model checking and solving games for specifications in PLTL with costs is not harder than the corresponding problems for LTL. Finally, we discuss PLDL with costs and extensions to multiple cost functions."

Processes communicate through a shared, bounded-value register. While each operation on the register is atomic, there is no synchronization primitive to execute a sequence of operations atomically.   We analyze the case in which processes are modeled by finite-state machines or pushdown machines and the property is given by a B\""uchi automaton over the alphabet of read and write actions of the leader. We show that the problem is decidable, and has a surprisingly low complexity: it is NP-complete when all processes are finite-state machines, and is PSPACE-hard and in NEXPTIME when they are pushdown machines. This complexity is lower than for the non-parameterized case: liveness verification of finitely many finite-state machines is PSPACE-complete, and undecidable for two pushdown machines.   For finite-state machines, our proofs characterize infinite behaviors using existential abstraction and semilinear constraints. For pushdown machines, we show how contributor computations of high stack height can be simulated by computations of many contributors, each with low stack height. Together, our results characterize the complexity of verification for parameterized systems under the assumptions of anonymity and asynchrony."

Soundness proofs are usually built from semantic arguments, and this is to our knowledge, the first proof that appeals to syntactic means. We actually prove the soundness property with respect to cut-free sequent calculus. This requires great care because of the additional liberty in freshness checking allowed by the use of Skolem terms. In contrast to semantic soundness, we gain the possibility to state a cut elimination theorem for sequent calculus, under the proviso that completeness of the method holds. We believe that such techniques can be applied to tableaux in other logics as well."
2015-05-17 15:47:49+00:00,2015-05-17 15:47:49+00:00,"A distributed protocol is typically modeled as a set of communicating processes, where each process is described as an extended state machine along with fairness assumptions, and its correctness is specified using safety and liveness requirements. Designing correct distributed protocols is a challenging task. Aimed at simplifying this task, we allow the designer to leave some of the guards and updates to state variables in the description of extended state machines as unknown functions. The protocol completion problem then is to find interpretations for these unknown functions while guaranteeing correctness. In many distributed protocols, process behaviors are naturally symmetric, and thus, synthesized expressions are further required to obey symmetry constraints. Our counterexample-guided synthesis algorithm consists of repeatedly invoking two phases. In the first phase, candidates for unknown expressions are generated using the SMT solver Z3. This phase requires carefully orchestrating constraints to enforce the desired symmetry in read/write accesses. In the second phase, the resulting completed protocol is checked for correctness using a custom-built model checker that handles fairness assumptions, safety and liveness requirements, and exploits symmetry. When model checking fails, our tool examines a set of counterexamples to safety/liveness properties to generate constraints on unknown functions that must be satisfied by subsequent completions. For evaluation, we show that our prototype is able to automatically discover interesting missing details in distributed protocols for mutual exclusion, self stabilization, and cache coherence."

In recent times, effective formal synthesis methods have been proposed based on the use of inductive learning. We refer to this class of methods that learn programs from examples as formal inductive synthesis. In this paper, we present a theoretical framework for formal inductive synthesis. We discuss how formal inductive synthesis differs from traditional machine learning. We then describe oracle-guided inductive synthesis (OGIS), a framework that captures a family of synthesizers that operate by iteratively querying an oracle. An instance of OGIS that has had much practical impact is counterexample-guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS). We present a theoretical characterization of CEGIS for learning any program that computes a recursive language. In particular, we analyze the relative power of CEGIS variants where the types of counterexamples generated by the oracle varies. We also consider the impact of bounded versus unbounded memory available to the learning algorithm. In the special case where the universe of candidate programs is finite, we relate the speed of convergence to the notion of teaching dimension studied in machine learning theory. Altogether, the results of the paper take a first step towards a theoretical foundation for the emerging field of formal inductive synthesis."

The I/O CRN receives its input as a continuous time signal consisting of concentrations of chemical species that vary to represent the NFA's input string in a natural way. The I/O CRN exploits the inherent parallelism of chemical kinetics to simulate the NFA in real time with a number of chemical species that is linear in the size of the NFA. We prove that the simulation is correct and that it is robust with respect to perturbations of the input signal, the initial concentrations of species, the output (decision), and the rate constants of the reactions of the I/O CRN."

More precisely we study the following criteria for a run to be accepting: - it contains at most finitely (resp countably) many rejecting branches; - it contains infinitely (resp uncountably) many accepting branches; - the set of accepting branches is topologically ""big"".   In all situations we provide a simple acceptance game that later permits to prove that the languages accepted by automata with cardinality constraints are always $\omega$-regular. In the case (ii) where one counts accepting branches it leads to new proofs (without appealing to logic) of an old result of Beauquier and Niwinski."

Our proof gives both algebraic and automata characterisation of the zero-one law for regular languages, and it leads the following two corollaries: (i) There is an O(n log n) algorithm for testing whether a given regular language has the zero-one law.

This proposal aims at formalizing parts of context-free language theory in the Coq proof assistant. This report presents the underlying theory and general characteristics of proof assistants, including Coq itself, discusses its use in relevant formalization projects, presents the current status of the implementation, addresses related projects and the contributions of this work. The results obtained so far include the formalization of closure properties for context-free grammars (under union, concatenation and closure) and the formalization of grammar simplification. Grammar simplification is a subject of high importance in computer language processing technology as well as in formal language theory, and the formalization refers to the fact that general context-free grammars generate languages that can be also generated by simpler and equivalent context-free grammars. Namely, useless symbol elimination, inaccessible symbol elimination, unit rules elimination and empty rules elimination operations were described and proven correct with respect to the preservation of the language generated by the original grammar."

On the one hand, we show that the problem remains undecidable for parametric timed automata with three clocks and one parameter. On the other hand, for the case with arbitrary many clocks where only one of these clocks is compared with (an arbitrary number of) parameters, we show that the parametric language emptiness is decidable. The undecidability result tightens the bounds of a previous result which assumed six parameters, while the decidability result extends the existing approaches that deal with discrete-time semantics only. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first positive result in the case of continuous-time and unbounded integer parameters, except for the rather simple case of single-clock automata."

In a distributed algorithm, an arbitrary number of processes cooperate to achieve a common goal (e.g., elect a leader). Processes have unique identifiers (pids) from an infinite, totally ordered domain. An algorithm proceeds in synchronous rounds, each round allowing a process to perform a bounded sequence of actions such as send or receive a pid, store it in some register, and compare register contents wrt. the associated total order. An algorithm is supposed to be correct independently of the number of processes. To specify correctness properties, we introduce a logic that can reason about processes and pids. Referring to leader election, it may say that, at the end of an execution, each process stores the maximum pid in some dedicated register. Since the verification of distributed algorithms is undecidable, we propose an underapproximation technique, which bounds the number of rounds. This is an appealing approach, as the number of rounds needed by a distributed algorithm to conclude is often exponentially smaller than the number of processes. We provide an automata-theoretic solution, reducing model checking to emptiness for alternating two-way automata on words. Overall, we show that round-bounded verification of distributed algorithms over rings is PSPACE-complete."

He also proved that the size of the giant follows a central limit law. We show that whp the part outside the giant contains at most a few short cycles and mostly consists of overlapping tree-like structures. Thus the directed acyclic graph (DAG) of a random $k$-out digraph is almost the same as the digraph with the giant contracted into one vertex.

2015-04-23 10:19:46+00:00,2015-04-23 10:19:46+00:00,"Recently there has been a significant effort to handle quantitative properties in formal verification and synthesis. While weighted automata over finite and infinite words provide a natural and flexible framework to express quantitative properties, perhaps surprisingly, some basic system properties such as average response time cannot be expressed using weighted automata, nor in any other know decidable formalism. In this work, we introduce nested weighted automata as a natural extension of weighted automata which makes it possible to express important quantitative properties such as average response time. In nested weighted automata, a master automaton spins off and collects results from weighted slave automata, each of which computes a quantity along a finite portion of an infinite word. Nested weighted automata can be viewed as the quantitative analogue of monitor automata, which are used in run-time verification. We establish an almost complete decidability picture for the basic decision problems about nested weighted automata, and illustrate their applicability in several domains. In particular, nested weighted automata can be used to decide average response time properties."

Although SLPs turn out to be exponentially more succinct than TSLPs, we show that many simple tree queries can still be performed efficiently on SLPs, such as computing the height and Horton-Strahler number of a tree, tree navigation, or evaluation of Boolean expressions. Other problems on tree traversals turn out to be intractable, e.g. pattern matching and evaluation of tree automata."

Given such a set of configurable machines, a line integrator is faced with the problem of finding and tuning parameters for each machine such that the overall production line implements given safety and temporal requirements in an optimized and robust fashion. We formalize this problem of configuring and orchestrating flexible production lines as a parameter synthesis problem for systems of parametric timed automata, where interactions are based on skills. Parameter synthesis problems for interaction-level LTL properties are translated to parameter synthesis problems for state-based safety properties. For safety properties, synthesis problems are solved by checking satisfiability of $\exists\forall$SMT constraints. For constraint generation, we provide a set of computationally cheap over-approximations of the set of reachable states, together with fence constructions as sufficient conditions for safety formulas. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by solving typical machine configuration problems as encountered in industrial automation."
2015-04-20 19:09:34+00:00,2016-12-12 17:23:16+00:00,"We study various complexity properties of suffix-free regular languages. The quotient complexity of a regular language $L$ is the number of left quotients of $L$; this is the same as the state complexity of $L$. A regular language $L'$ is a dialect of a regular language $L$ if it differs only slightly from $L$. The quotient complexity of an operation on regular languages is the maximal quotient complexity of the result of the operation expressed as a function of the quotient complexities of the operands. A sequence $(L_k,L_{k+1},\dots)$ of regular languages in some class ${\mathcal C}$, where $n$ is the quotient complexity of $L_n$, is called a stream. A stream is most complex in class ${\mathcal C}$ if its languages $L_n$ meet the complexity upper bounds for all basic measures. It is known that there exist such most complex streams in the class of regular languages, in the class of prefix-free languages, and also in the classes of right, left, and two-sided ideals. In contrast to this, we prove that there does not exist a most complex stream in the class of suffix-free regular languages. However, we do exhibit one ternary suffix-free stream that meets the bound for product and whose restrictions to binary alphabets meet the bounds for star and boolean operations. We also exhibit a quinary stream that meets the bounds for boolean operations, reversal, size of syntactic semigroup, and atom complexities. Moreover, we solve an open problem about the bound for the product of two languages of quotient complexities $m$ and $n$ in the binary case by showing that it can be met for infinitely many $m$ and $n$."

In this work, we extend its capabilities by implementing methods to manipulate transducers and we go one level higher than existing formal language systems and implement methods to manipulate objects representing classes of independent languages (widely known as code properties). Our methods allow users to define their own code properties and combine them between themselves or with fixed properties such as prefix codes, suffix codes, error detecting codes, etc. The satisfaction and maximality decision questions are solvable for any of the definable properties. The new online system LaSer allows to query about code properties and obtain the answer in a batch mode. Our work is founded on independence theory as well as the theory of rational relations and transducers and contributes with improveded algorithms on these objects."

They are well suited to model and analyze real-time operating systems. Here we extend ITA with polynomial guards and updates, leading to the class of polynomial ITA (PolITA). We prove the decidability of the reachability and model checking of a timed version of CTL by an adaptation of the cylindrical decomposition method for the first-order theory of reals. Compared to previous approaches, our procedure handles parameters and clocks in a unified way. Moreover, we show that PolITA are incomparable with stopwatch automata. Finally additional features are introduced while preserving decidability."

This problem was proved undecidable recently; to overcome this, several classes of probabilistic automata of different nature were proposed, for which the value 1 problem has been shown decidable. In this paper, we introduce yet another class of probabilistic automata, called leaktight automata, which strictly subsumes all classes of probabilistic automata whose value 1 problem is known to be decidable. We prove that for leaktight automata, the value 1 problem is decidable (in fact, PSPACE-complete) by constructing a saturation algorithm based on the computation of a monoid abstracting the behaviours of the automaton. We rely on algebraic techniques developed by Simon to prove that this abstraction is complete. Furthermore, we adapt this saturation algorithm to decide whether an automaton is leaktight. Finally, we show a reduction allowing to extend our decidability results from finite words to infinite ones, implying that the value 1 problem for probabilistic leaktight parity automata is decidable."

LDL itself was proposed as an extension of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) that is able to express all omega-regular specifications while still maintaining many of LTL's desirable properties like intuitive syntax and semantics and a translation into non-deterministic B\""uchi automata of exponential size. But LDL lacks capabilities to express timing constraints. By adding parameterized operators to LDL, we obtain a logic that is able to express all omega-regular properties and that subsumes parameterized extensions of LTL like Parametric LTL and PROMPT-LTL.   Our main technical contribution is a translation of PLDL formulas into non-deterministic B\""uchi automata of exponential size via alternating automata. This yields polynomial space algorithms for model checking and assume-guarantee model checking and a realizability algorithm with doubly-exponential running time. All three problems are also shown to be complete for these complexity classes. Moreover, we give tight upper and lower bounds on optimal parameter values for model checking and realizability. Using these bounds, we present a polynomial space procedure for model checking optimization and an algorithm with triply-exponential running time for realizability optimization. Our results show that PLDL model checking and realizability are no harder than their respective (parametric) LTL counterparts."

A particular kind of rational relations is the sequential functions. Sequential functions are the functions that can be realised by input-deterministic transducers. Some rational functions are not sequential. However, based on a property on transducers called the twinning property, it is decidable in PTime whether a rational function given by an NFT is sequential. In this paper, we investigate the generalisation of this result to multi-sequential relations, i.e. relations that are equal to a finite union of sequential functions. We show that given an NFT, it is decidable in PTime whether the relation it defines is multi-sequential, based on a property called the weak twinning property. If the weak twinning property is satisfied, we give a procedure that effectively constructs a finite set of input-deterministic transducers whose union defines the relation. This procedure generalises to arbitrary NFT the determinisation procedure of functional NFT."

MPGs are suitable quantitative models for open reactive systems. However, in this context the assumption of perfect information is not always realistic. For the partial-observation case, the problem that asks if the first player has an observation-based winning strategy that enforces a given threshold on the mean-payoff, is undecidable. In this paper, we study the window mean-payoff objectives that were introduced recently as an alternative to the classical mean-payoff objectives. We show that, in sharp contrast to the classical mean-payoff objectives, some of the window mean-payoff objectives are decidable in games with partial-observation."

A discrete representation of string diagrams, called string graphs, allows for mechanised equational reasoning by double-pushout rewriting. However, one often wishes to express not just single equations, but entire families of equations between diagrams of arbitrary size. To do this we define a class of context-free grammars, called B-ESG grammars, that are suitable for defining entire families of string graphs, and crucially, of string graph rewrite rules. We show that the language-membership and match-enumeration problems are decidable for these grammars, and hence that there is an algorithm for rewriting string graphs according to B-ESG rewrite patterns. We also show that it is possible to reason at the level of grammars by providing a simple method for transforming a grammar by string graph rewriting, and showing admissibility of the induced B-ESG rewrite pattern."

Assuming that D is an entropic variety of algebras, we prove that the syntactic D-monoid of a language L can be constructed as a quotient of a free D-monoid modulo the syntactic congruence of L, and that it is isomorphic to the transition D-monoid of the minimal automaton for L in D. Furthermore, in case the variety D is locally finite, we characterize the regular languages as precisely the languages with finite syntactic D-monoids."

In order to decrease the complexity of related problems, one can consider adaptive experiments when a next input to be applied to a system under experiment depends on the output responses to the previous inputs. In this paper, we study the problem of the existence of an adaptive homing experiment for complete observable nondeterministic machines. We show that if such experiment exists then it can be constructed with the use of a polynomial-time algorithm with respect to the number of FSM states."

Several new models of computation have emerged in the last years, and many developments of traditional computational models have been proposed with the aim of taking into account the new demands of computer systems users and the new capabilities of computation engines. A new computational model, or a new feature in a traditional one, usually is reflected in a new family of programming languages, and new paradigms of software development.   The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers who are currently developing new computational models or new features for traditional computational models, in order to foster their interaction, to provide a forum for presenting new ideas and work in progress, and to enable newcomers to learn about current activities in this area. Topics of interest include all abstract models of computation and their applications to the development of programming languages and systems."

In this work, we are interested in strategies of Eve that minimize her regret, i.e. strategies that minimize the difference between her actual payoff and the payoff she could have achieved if she had known the strategy of Adam in advance. We give algorithms to compute the strategies of Eve that ensure minimal regret against an adversary whose choice of strategy is (i) unrestricted, (ii) limited to positional strategies, or (iii) limited to word strategies.

This paper studies the concept of complete simulation in the context of semigroups of transformations of $A^n$, also known as finite state-homogeneous automata networks. For $m \geq n$, a transformation of $A^m$ is \emph{$n$-complete of size $m$} if it may simulate every transformation of $A^n$ by updating one coordinate (or register) at a time. Using tools from memoryless computation, it is established that there is no $n$-complete transformation of size $n$, but there is such a transformation of size $n+1$. By studying the the time of simulation of various $n$-complete transformations, it is conjectured that the maximal time of simulation of any $n$-complete transformation is at least $2n$. A transformation of $A^m$ is \emph{sequentially $n$-complete of size $m$} if it may sequentially simulate every finite sequence of transformations of $A^n$; in this case, minimal examples and bounds for the size and time of simulation are determined. It is also shown that there is no $n$-complete transformation that updates all the registers in parallel, but that there exists a sequentally $n$-complete transformation that updates all but one register in parallel. This illustrates the strengths and weaknesses of parallel models of computation, such as cellular automata."

A special class of multi-counter automata is introduced, to formulate shuffle projection in terms of computations of these automata represented by transductions. This reformulation of shuffle projection leads to construction principles for pairs of languages closed under shuffle projection. Additionally, it is shown that under certain conditions these transductions are rational, which implies decidability of closure against shuffle projection. Decidability of these conditions is proven for regular languages. Finally, without additional conditions, decidability of the question, whether a pair of regular languages is closed under shuffle projection, is shown. In an appendix the relation between shuffle projection and the shuffle product of two languages is discussed. Additionally, a kind of shuffle product for computations in S-automata is defined."

This allows us to perform a case study with automatically inferring bidirectional transformations between 11 grammars (in a broad sense) of the same artificial functional language: parser specifications with different combinator libraries, definite clause grammars, concrete syntax definitions, algebraic data types, metamodels, XML schemata, object models."

We observe that uf(L) need not be context-free if L is context-free.   Next, we consider variations on unique factorization. We define a notion of ""semi-unique"" factorization, where every factorization has the same number of terms, and show that, if L is regular or even finite, the set of words having such a factorization need not be context-free.

Hence, the functional correctness of a cyber- physical system is crucially dependent not only on the dynamics of the analog physical environment, but also on the decisions taken by the discrete control that alter the dynamics of the environment. The framework of Hybrid automata---introduced by Alur, Courcoubetis, Henzinger, and Ho---provides a formal modeling and specification environment to analyze the interaction between the discrete and continuous parts of a cyber-physical system. Hybrid automata can be considered as generalizations of finite state automata augmented with a finite set of real-valued variables whose dynamics in each state is governed by a system of ordinary differential equations. Moreover, the discrete transitions of hybrid automata are guarded by constraints over the values of these real-valued variables, and enable discontinuous jumps in the evolution of these variables. Considering the richness of the dynamics in a hybrid automaton, it is perhaps not surprising that the fundamental verification questions, like reachability and schedulability, for the general model are undecidable. In this article we present a review of hybrid automata as modeling and verification framework for cyber-physical systems, and survey some of the key results related to practical verification questions related to hybrid automata."

As our first result we prove that the model of dense-timed PDA of Abdulla et al. collapses: it is expressively equivalent to dense-timed PDA with timeless stack. Motivated by this result, we advocate the framework of first-order definable PDA, a specialization of PDA in sets with atoms, as the right setting to define and investigate timed extensions of PDA. The general model obtained in this way is Turing complete. As our second result we prove NEXPTIME upper complexity bound for the non-emptiness problem for an expressive subclass. As a byproduct, we obtain a tight EXPTIME complexity bound for a more restrictive subclass of PDA with timeless stack, thus subsuming the complexity bound known for dense-timed PDA."

The quotient complexity of a regular language $L$ is the number of quotients of $L$; it is equal to the state complexity of $L$, which is the number of states in a minimal deterministic finite automaton accepting $L$. An atom of $L$ is an equivalence class of the relation in which two words are equivalent if for each quotient, they either are both in the quotient or both not in it; hence it is a non-empty intersection of complemented and uncomplemented quotients of $L$. A right (respectively, left and two-sided) ideal is a language $L$ over an alphabet $\Sigma$ that satisfies $L=L\Sigma^*$ (respectively, $L=\Sigma^*L$ and $L=\Sigma^*L\Sigma^*$).

It is well-known that the downward closure of any language is regular. While the downward closure appears to be a powerful abstraction, algorithms for computing a finite automaton for the downward closure of a given language have been established only for few language classes.   This work presents a simple general method for computing downward closures. For language classes that are closed under rational transductions, it is shown that the computation of downward closures can be reduced to checking a certain unboundedness property.   This result is used to prove that downward closures are computable for (i) every language class with effectively semilinear Parikh images that are closed under rational transductions, (ii) matrix languages, and (iii) indexed languages (equivalently, languages accepted by higher-order pushdown automata of order 2)."

This characteristic is compatible with rational dominance. We present examples of P-complete RR problems as well as examples of RR problems in the class NL. Also we discuss RR problems with context-free filters that might have intermediate complexity. Possible candidates are the languages with polynomially bounded rational indices."

We start by proving the decidability of the problem ""does the system have a solution ?"" for a simple class of Horn systems with one second-order variable and one non-linear recursive rule. The proof relies on a construction of a tree automaton recognizing all cycles in the weighted graph corresponding to every unfolding tree of the Horn system. We constrain the tree to recognize only cycles of negative weight by adding a Presburger formula that harnesses the number of times each rule is fired, and reduce our problem to the universality of a Presburger-constrained tree automaton. We studied the complexity of this problem and found it to be in \textsc{NEXPtime} with an \textsc{EXPtime}-hard lower bound. Second, we drop the univariate restriction and consider multivariate second-order Horn systems with a structural restriction, called \emph{flatness}. This more general class of Horn systems is found to be decidable, within the same complexity bounds. Finally, we encode the reachability problem for Alternating Branching Vector Addition Systems (ABVASS) using Horn systems and prove that, for flat ABVASS, this problem is in co-\textsc{NEXPtime}."

Here we define DNA code properties via transducers and show that this method is strictly more expressive than that of trajectories, without sacrificing the efficiency of deciding the satisfaction question. We also show that the maximality question can be undecidable. Our undecidability results hold not only for the fixed DNA involution but also for any fixed antimorphic permutation.

In a recent contribution, Albert Eschenmoser emphasised the importance of catalytic and autocatalytic cycles in establishing such abiotic synthesis pathways. The accumulation of intermediate products furthermore provides additional catalysts that allow pathways to change over time. We show here that generative models of chemical spaces based on graph grammars make it possible to study such phenomena is a systematic manner. In addition to repro- ducing the key steps of Eschenmoser's hypothesis paper, we discovered previously unexplored potentially autocatalytic pathways from HCN to glyoxylate. A cascading of autocatalytic cycles could efficiently re-route matter, distributed over the combinatorial complex network of HCN hydrolysation chemistry, towards a potential primordial metabolism. The generative approach also has it intrinsic limitations: the unsupervised expansion of the chemical space remains infeasible due to the exponential growth of possible molecules and reactions between them. Here in particular the combinatorial complexity of the HCN polymerisation and hydrolysation networks forms the computational bottleneck. As a consequence, guidance of the computational exploration by chemical experience is indispensable."

In particular, it is an indexed language in the sense of Aho. The question of whether a description of solution sets in reduced words as an indexed language is possible has been been open for some years, apparently without much hope that a positive answer could hold. Nevertheless, our answer goes far beyond: they are EDT0L, which is a proper subclass of indexed languages. We can additionally handle the existential theory of equations with rational constraints in free products $\star_{1 \leq i \leq s}F_i$, where each $F_i$ is either a free or finite group, or a free monoid with involution. In all cases the result is the same: the set of all solutions in reduced words is EDT0L. This was known only for quadratic word equations by Fert\'e, Marin and S\'enizergues (ToCS 2014), which is a very restricted case. Our general result became possible due to the recent recompression technique of Je\.z. In this paper we use a new method to integrate solutions of linear Diophantine equations into the process and obtain more general results than in the related paper (arXiv 1405.5133). For example, we improve the complexity from quadratic nondeterministic space in (arXiv 1405.5133) to quasi-linear nondeterministic space here. This implies an improved complexity for deciding the existential theory of non-abelian free groups: NSPACE($n\log n$). The conjectured complexity is NP, however, we believe that our results are optimal with respect to space complexity, independent of the conjectured NP."

Compared with a recent work (Bianchi, Mereghetti, Palano, Theoret. Comput.

Thus, we introduce and analyze, in this theoretical study, a new model for the FI mining task. Indeed, we encode the itemsets as words over an ordered alphabet, and state this problem by a formal series over the counting semiring $(\mathbb{N},+,\times,0,1)$, whose range constitutes the itemsets and the coefficients are their supports. This formalism offers many advantages in both fundamental and practical aspects: the introduction of a clear and unified theoretical framework through which we can express the main FI-approaches, the possibility of their generalization to mine other more complex objects, and their incrementalisation or parallelisation; in practice, we explain how this problem can be seen as that of word recognition by an automaton, allowing an efficient implementation in $O(|Q|)$ space and $O(|\mathcal{F}_L||Q|])$ time, where $Q$ is the set of states of the automaton used for representing the data, and $\mathcal{F}_L$ the set of prefixial longest FI."

In such schemes, a computational process is responsible for signalling an end of a calculation by setting a halt bit, which needs to be systematically checked by an observer. The capacity of quantum computational models to operate on a superposition of states requires an alternative approach. From a quantum perspective, any measurement of an equivalent halt qubit would have the potential to inherently interfere with the computation by provoking a random collapse amongst the states. This issue is exacerbated by undecidable problems such as the \textit{Entscheidungsproblem} which require universal computational models, \textit{e.g.} the classical Turing machine, to be able to proceed indefinitely. In this work we present an alternative view of quantum computation based on production system theory in conjunction with Grover's amplitude amplification scheme that allows for (1) a detection of halt states without interfering with the final result of a computation; (2) the possibility of non-terminating computation and (3) an inherent speedup to occur during computations susceptible of parallelization.

For a finite-state automaton $\mathfrak A$, it is shown that once some points of $\mathbf P(\mathfrak A)$ constitute a smooth (of a class $C^2$) curve in $\mathbb R^2$, the curve is a segment of a straight line with a rational slope; and there are only finitely many straight lines whose segments are in $\mathbf{P}(\mathfrak A)$. Moreover, when identifying $\mathbf P(\mathfrak A)$ with a subset of a 2-dimensional torus $\mathbb T^2\subset\mathbb R^3$ (under a natural mapping of the real unit square $[0,1]^2$ onto $\mathbb T^2$) the smooth curves from $\mathbf P(\mathfrak A)$ constitute a collection of torus windings. In cylindrical coordinates either of the windings can be ascribed to a complex-valued function $\psi(x)=e^{i(Ax-2\pi B(t))}$ $(x\in\mathbb R)$ for suitable rational $A,B(t)$. Since $\psi(x)$ is a standard expression for a matter wave in quantum theory (where $B(t)=tB(t_0)$), and since transducers can be regarded as a mathematical formalization for causal discrete systems, the paper might serve as a mathematical reasoning why wave phenomena are inherent in quantum systems: This is because of causality principle and the discreteness of matter."

The relationship between rational series and WFA is analogous to the relationship between regular languages and ordinary automata.

This paper takes the first step in characterising these languages by showing that an important subclass of !-graphs--those whose repeated structures only overlap trivially--can be encoded using a (context-free) vertex replacement grammar."

In the present paper this result is generalized to an abstract pair of algebraic categories: we introduce varieties of languages in a category C, and prove that they correspond to pseudovarieties of monoids in a closed monoidal category D, provided that C and D are dual on the level of finite objects. By suitable choices of these categories our result uniformly covers Eilenberg's theorem and three variants due to Pin, Polak and Reutenauer, respectively, and yields new Eilenberg-type correspondences."
2015-01-20 14:58:13+00:00,2015-01-20 14:58:13+00:00,"Encodings, that is, injective functions from words to words, have been studied extensively in several settings. In computability theory the notion of encoding is crucial for defining computability on arbitrary domains, as well as for comparing the power of models of computation. In language theory much attention has been devoted to regularity preserving functions.   A natural question arising in these contexts is: Is there a bijective encoding such that its image function preserves regularity of languages, but its pre-image function does not? Our main result answers this question in the affirmative: For every countable class C of languages there exists a bijective encoding f such that for every language L in C its image f[L] is regular.   Our construction of such encodings has several noteworthy consequences. Firstly, anomalies arise when models of computation are compared with respect to a known concept of implementation that is based on encodings which are not required to be computable: Every countable decision model can be implemented, in this sense, by finite-state automata, even via bijective encodings. Hence deterministic finite-state automata would be equally powerful as Turing machine deciders.   A second consequence concerns the recognizability of sets of natural numbers via number representations and finite automata. A set of numbers is said to be recognizable with respect to a representation if an automaton accepts the language of representations. Our result entails that there is one number representation with respect to which every recursive set is recognizable."

This work studies the equivalent transformation from a legal-marking set to its admissible-marking set given such a net. First, the concepts of an escaping-marking set and a transforming marking set are defined. Based on them, two algorithms are given to compute the admissible-marking set and the transforming marking set, which establish the theoretical foundation for the equivalent transformation of linear constraints. Second, the theory about the equivalent transformation of a disjunction of linear constraints imposed to Petri nets with uncontrollable transitions is established. Third, two rules are given to decide the priority of transitions for transformation. Finally, the transformation procedure from a given linear constraint to a logic expression of linear constraints that can describe its entire admissible-marking set is illustrated via two examples."

In this paper we construct a 1-counter graph automatic structure for F based on the standard infinite normal form for group elements."

In order to solve this problem, the QPA needed a unitary operator to carry out the QPA evolution and a boundary partition to make the classification decisions. We designed a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to search for the unitary operators and the boundary partitions to classify the density of binary inputs with length 5. The GA was able to find more than one unitary operator that can transform the QPA in ways such that when the particle was measured, it was more likely to collapse to the basis states that were on the correct side of the boundary partition for the QPA to decide if the binary input had majority density 0 or majority density 1. We analyzed these solutions and found that the QPA evolution dynamic was driven by a particular parameter $\theta$ of the unitary operator: a small $\theta$ gave the particle small mass hence fast evolution while large $\theta$ had the opposite effect. While these results are encouraging, scaling these solutions for binary inputs of arbitrary length of $n$ requires additional analysis, which we will investigate in our future work."

The first contribution of this paper is to give a characterisation of the Markov Monoid algorithm. The second contribution is to develop a profinite theory for probabilistic automata, called the prostochastic theory. This new framework gives a topological account of the value 1 problem, which in this context is cast as an emptiness problem. The above characterisation is reformulated using the prostochastic theory, allowing us to give a simple and modular proof."

In contrast, model-based language processing tools decouple language design from language processing.

As a result, these techniques require scanners and parsers able to parse context-free grammars, handle ambiguities, and enforce constraints for disambiguation. In this paper, we present Lamb and Fence. Lamb is a scanning algorithm that supports ambiguous token definitions and the specification of custom pattern matchers and constraints. Fence is a chart parsing algorithm that supports ambiguous context-free grammars and the definition of constraints on associativity, composition, and precedence, as well as custom constraints.

Formal grammars, typically in the form of BNF-like productions, describe the language syntax, which is then annotated for syntax-directed translation and completed with semantic actions. When, apart from the textual representation of data, an explicit representation of the corresponding data structure is required, the language designer has to devise the mapping between the suitable data model and its proper language specification, and then develop the conversion procedure from the parse tree to the data model instance. Unfortunately, whenever the format of the textual representation has to be modified, changes have to propagated throughout the entire language processor tool chain. These updates are time-consuming, tedious, and error-prone. Besides, in case different applications use the same language, several copies of the same language specification have to be maintained. In this paper, we introduce ModelCC, a model-based parser generator that decouples language specification from language processing, hence avoiding many of the problems caused by grammar-driven parsers and parser generators. ModelCC incorporates reference resolution within the parsing process. Therefore, instead of returning mere abstract syntax trees, ModelCC is able to obtain abstract syntax graphs from input strings."

The C-membership problem asks for an algorithm to decide whether an input language belongs to C. The C-separation problem asks for an algorithm that, given as input two regular languages, decides whether there exists a third language in C containing the first language, while being disjoint from the second. These problems are considered as means to obtain a deep understanding of the class C.   It is usual for such classes to be defined by logical formalisms. Logics are often built on top of each other, by adding new predicates. A natural construction is to enrich a logic with the successor relation. In this paper, we obtain simple self-contained proofs of two transfer results: we show that for suitable logically defined classes, the membership, resp. the separation problem for a class enriched with the successor relation reduces to the same problem for the original class.   Our reductions work both for languages of finite words and infinite words. The proofs are mostly self-contained, and only require a basic background on regular languages.

We express the condition that an automaton is synchronizing in terms of linear algebra, and obtain upper bounds for the reset thresholds of automata with a short word of a small rank. The results are applied to make several improvements in the area.   We improve the best general upper bound for reset thresholds of finite prefix codes (Huffman codes): we show that an $n$-state synchronizing decoder has a reset word of length at most $O(n \log^3 n)$. In addition to that, we prove that the expected reset threshold of a uniformly random synchronizing binary $n$-state decoder is at most $O(n \log n)$. We also show that for any non-unary alphabet there exist decoders whose reset threshold is in $\varTheta(n)$.   We prove the \v{C}ern\'{y} conjecture for $n$-state automata with a letter of rank at most $\sqrt[3]{6n-6}$. In another corollary, based on the recent results of Nicaud, we show that the probability that the \v{C}ern\'y conjecture does not hold for a random synchronizing binary automaton is exponentially small in terms of the number of states, and also that the expected value of the reset threshold of an $n$-state random synchronizing binary automaton is at most $n^{3/2+o(1)}$.   Moreover, reset words of lengths within all of our bounds are computable in polynomial time. We present suitable algorithms for this task for various classes of automata, such as (quasi-)one-cluster and (quasi-)Eulerian automata, for which our results can be applied."

The problem of constructing finite complete rewriting systems, and biautomatic structures, for crystal monoids is then investigated. In the case of Kashiwara crystals of types $A_n$, $B_n$, $C_n$, $D_n$, and $G_2$ (corresponding to the $q$-analogues of the Lie algebras of these types) these monoids are precisely the generalised plactic monoids investigated in work of Lecouvey. We construct presentations via finite complete rewriting systems for all of these types using a unified proof strategy that depends on Kashiwara's crystal bases and analogies of Young tableaux, and on Lecouvey's presentations for these monoids. As corollaries, we deduce that plactic monoids of these types have finite derivation type and satisfy the homological finiteness properties left and right $\mathrm{FP}_\infty$. These rewriting systems are then applied to show that plactic monoids of these types are biautomatic and thus have word problem soluble in quadratic time."

Here we apply this approach to concrete domains that are tree-like and obtain several results. We show that satisfiability of $\mathsf{ECTL}^*$ with constraints is decidable over (i) semi-linear orders (i.e., tree-like structures where branches form arbitrary linear orders), (ii) ordinal trees (semi-linear orders where the branches form ordinals), and (iii) infinitely branching trees of height h for each fixed $h\in \mathbb{N}$.

Since this bound is known to be reachable, this settles the problem.

However, sequential regular expression matching may be time-prohibitive for large problem sizes. In this paper, we describe a novel algorithm for parallel regular expression matching via deterministic finite automata. Furthermore, we present our tool PaREM that accepts regular expressions and finite automata as input and automatically generates the corresponding code for our algorithm that is amenable for parallel execution on shared-memory systems. We evaluate our parallel algorithm empirically by comparing it with a commonly used algorithm for sequential regular expression matching. Experiments on a dual-socket shared-memory system with 24 physical cores show speed-ups of up to 21x for 48 threads."

The result can be used to find the minimal $k$ for which the language is $k$-PT.

Cerny in 2010 as a one-way deterministic automata model to define transformations of finite strings. Copyless SST extend deterministic finite state automata with a set of registers in which to store intermediate output strings, and those registers can be combined and updated all along the run, in a linear manner, i.e., no register content can be copied on transitions. It is known that copyless SST capture exactly the class of MSO-definable string-to-string transformations, as defined by B. Courcelle, and are equi-expressive to deterministic two-way transducers. They enjoy good algorithmic properties. Most notably, they have decidable equivalence problem (in PSpace). In this paper, we show that they still have decidable equivalence problem even without the copyless restriction. The proof reduces to the HDT0L sequence equivalence problem, which is known to be decidable.

For every language $L$, there exists such a two-way quantum finite automaton that recognizes a language of the same Turing degree as $L$ with bounded error in polynomial time.

The well-known dynamic programming algorithm solves this problem in $O(n^3)$ time (ignoring grammar size) where $n$ is the string length [Aho, Peterson 1972, Myers 1985]. Despite its vast number of applications, there is no algorithm known till date that computes or approximates Lan-ED in true sub-cubic time.   In this paper we give the first such algorithm that computes Lan-ED almost optimally. For any arbitrary $\epsilon > 0$, our algorithm runs in $\tilde{O}(\frac{n^{\omega}}{poly(\epsilon)})$ time and returns an estimate within a multiplicative approximation factor of $(1+\epsilon)$, where $\omega$ is the exponent of ordinary matrix multiplication of $n$ dimensional square matrices. It also computes the edit script. Further, for all substrings of $s$, we can estimate their Lan-ED within $(1\pm \epsilon)$ factor in $\tilde{O}(\frac{n^{\omega}}{poly(\epsilon)})$ time with high probability. We also design the very first sub-cubic ($\tilde{O}(n^\omega)$) algorithm to handle arbitrary stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) parsing. SCFGs lie at the foundation of statistical natural language processing, they generalize hidden Markov models, and have found widespread applications.   To complement our upper bound result, we show that exact computation of SCFG parsing, or Lan-ED with insertion as only edit operation in true sub-cubic time will imply a truly sub-cubic algorithm for all-pairs shortest paths, and hence to a large range of problems in graphs and matrices. Known lower bound results on parsing implies no improvement over our time bound of $O(n^\omega)$ is possible for any nontrivial multiplicative approximation."

Session automata have an expressiveness partly extending, partly reducing that of classical register automata.

The main purpose of this paper is to explore the promise problems accepted by classical, quantum and also semi-quantum finite automata. More specifically, we first introduce two acceptance modes of promise problems, recognizability and solvability, and explore their basic properties. Afterwards, we show several results concerning descriptional complexity on promise problems. In particular, we prove: (1) there is a promise problem that can be recognized exactly by measure-once one-way quantum finite automata (MO-1QFA), but no deterministic finite automata (DFA) can recognize it; (2) there is a promise problem that can be solved with error probability $\epsilon\leq 1/3$ by one-way finite automaton with quantum and classical states (1QCFA), but no one-way probability finite automaton (PFA) can solve it with error probability $\epsilon\leq 1/3$; and especially, (3) there are promise problems $A(p)$ with prime $p$ that can be solved {\em with any error probability} by MO-1QFA with only two quantum basis states, but they can not be solved exactly by any MO-1QFA with two quantum basis states; in contrast, the minimal PFA solving $A(p)$ with any error probability (usually smaller than $1/2$) has $p$ states.

To overcome this problem, we propose to identify abstract models of middleware as finite-state automata, and then to perform verification on the combined middleware and control software models. Both steps are carried out in a computer-assisted way using state-of-the-art techniques in automata-based identification and verification.

Second, we give tight bounds on the maximum length and minimum expected time of constructed polymers in systems of three increasingly restricted classes. We prove that systems of $k$ monomer types can deterministically construct polymers of length $n = 2^{\Theta(k^{3/2})}$ in $O(\log^{5/3}(n))$ expected time. We also prove that if non-deterministic construction of a finite number of polymers is permitted, then the expected construction time can be reduced to $O(\log^{3/2}(n))$ at the trade-off of decreasing the length to $2^{\Theta(k)}$. If the system is allowed to construct an infinite number of polymers, then constructing polymers of unbounded length in $O(\log{n})$ expected time is possible.

Control improvisation has multiple applications, including, for example, generating musical improvisations that satisfy rhythmic and melodic constraints, where admissibility is determined by some bounded divergence from a reference melody. We analyze the complexity of the control improvisation problem, giving cases where it is efficiently solvable and cases where it is #P-hard or undecidable.

Particularly significant determinization methods are those that provide a minimal crisp-deterministic fuzzy automaton equivalent to the original fuzzy finite automaton, called canonization methods. One canonization method for fuzzy finite automata, the Brzozowski type determinization, has been developed recently by Jan\v{c}i\'{c} and \'{C}iri\'{c} in [10]. Here we provide another canonization method for a fuzzy finite automaton $\cal A=(A,\sigma, \delta,\tau)$ over a complete residuated lattice $\cal L$, based on the degrees of inclusion of the right fuzzy languages associated with states of $\cal A$ into the left derivatives of the fuzzy language recognized by $\cal A$. The proposed procedure terminates in a finite number of steps whenever the membership values taken by $\delta $, $\sigma $ and $\tau $ generate a finite subsemiring of the semiring reduct of $\cal L$. This procedure is generally faster than the Brzozowski type determinization, and if the basic operations in the residuated lattice $\cal L$ can be performed in constant time, it has the same computational time as all other determinization procedures provided in [8], [11], [12]."

Finally, we consider the minimal consistency problem: does there exist an automaton with $n$ states that is consistent with a given finite sample of weight-labelled words or trees? We show that this decision problem is complete for the existential theory of the rationals, both for words and for trees of a fixed alphabet rank."

These are structures whose domain and relations can be represented by automata reading finite words whose shape is some fixed ordinal $\alpha$. We lift Delhomm\'e's relative-growth-technique from the automatic and tree-automatic setting to the ordinal-automatic setting. This result implies that the random graph is not ordinal-automatic and infinite integral domains are not ordinal-automatic with respect to ordinals below $\omega_1+\omega^\omega$ where $\omega_1$ is the first uncountable ordinal."

The second one is the synchronizing probability function of an automaton, a recently introduced tool which reinterprets the synchronizing phenomenon as a two-player game, and allows to obtain optimal strategies through a Linear Program.   Our contribution is twofold. First, by coupling two different novel approaches based on the synchronizing probability function and properties of linear programming, we obtain a new upper bound on the triple rendezvous time. Second, by exhibiting a family of counterexamples, we disprove a conjecture on the growth of the synchronizing probability function. We then suggest natural follow-ups towards Cernys conjecture."

Specifically, our method can (soundly and completely) decide if computed values are polynomially bounded as a function of the input; and similarly for the running time. Such complexity properties are undecidable for a Turing-complete programming language, and a common work-around in program analysis is to settle for sound but incomplete solutions. In contrast, we consider a class of programs that is Turing-incomplete, but strong enough to include several challenges for this kind of analysis. For a related language that has well-structured syntax, similar to Meyer and Ritchie's LOOP programs, the problem has been previously proved to be decidable. The analysis relied on the compositionality of programs, hence the challenge in obtaining similar results for flowchart programs with arbitrary control-flow graphs. Our answer to the challenge is twofold: first, we propose a class of loop-annotated flowcharts, which is more general than the class of flowcharts that directly represent structured programs; secondly, we present a technique to reuse the ideas from the work on tructured programs and apply them to such flowcharts. The technique is inspired by the classic translation of non-deterministic automata to regular expressions, but we obviate the exponential cost of constructing such an expression, obtaining a polynomial-time analysis. These ideas may well be applicable to other analysis problems."

Standard approaches deciding the containment do not take extended operators or character sets into account. The algorithm avoids the translation to an expression-equivalent automaton and provides a purely symbolic term rewriting systems for solving regular expressions inequalities.   We give a new symbolic decision procedure for the containment problem based on Brzozowski's regular expression derivatives and Antimirov's rewriting approach to check containment. We generalize Brzozowski's syntactic derivative operator to two derivative operators that work with respect to (potentially infinite) representable character sets.

(2) We present a family of CFGs for which the minimal deterministic finite automata representing their subword closure matches the upper-bound of $2^{2^{\mathcal{O}(n)}}$ following from (1).

Tree Automata Completion is a family of techniques for computing or approximating the set of terms reachable by a rewriting relation. The completion algorithm we focus on is parameterized by a set E of equations controlling the precision of the approximation and influencing its termination. For completion to be used as a static analysis, the first step is to guarantee its termination. In this work, we thus give a sufficient condition on E and T(F) for completion algorithm to always terminate. In the particular setting of functional programs, this condition can be relaxed into a condition on E and T(C) (terms built on the set of constructors) that is closer to what is done in the field of static analysis, where abstractions are performed on data."
2014-10-04 12:04:25+00:00,2017-12-04 15:07:13+00:00,"The separability problem for word languages of a class $\mathcal{C}$ by languages of a class $\mathcal{S}$ asks, for two given languages $I$ and $E$ from $\mathcal{C}$, whether there exists a language $S$ from $\mathcal{S}$ that includes $I$ and excludes $E$, that is, $I \subseteq S$ and $S\cap E = \emptyset$. In this work, we assume some mild closure properties for $\mathcal{C}$ and study for which such classes separability by a piecewise testable language (PTL) is decidable. We characterize these classes in terms of decidability of (two variants of) an unboundedness problem. From this, we deduce that separability by PTL is decidable for a number of language classes, such as the context-free languages and languages of labeled vector addition systems. Furthermore, it follows that separability by PTL is decidable if and only if one can compute for any language of the class its downward closure wrt. the scattered substring ordering (i.e., if the set of scattered substrings of any language of the class is effectively regular).   The obtained decidability results contrast some undecidability results. In fact, for all (non-regular) language classes that we present as examples with decidable separability, it is undecidable whether a given language is a PTL itself.   Our characterization involves a result of independent interest, which states that for any kind of languages $I$ and $E$, non-separability by PTL is equivalent to the existence of common patterns in $I$ and $E$."

They showed that some NP-complete properties such as Hamiltonicity can be decided in polynomial time on digraphs of constant directed treewidth. Nevertheless, despite more than one decade of intensive research, the list of hard combinatorial problems that are known to be solvable in polynomial time when restricted to digraphs of constant directed treewidth has remained scarce. In this work we enrich this list by providing for the first time an algorithmic metatheorem connecting the monadic second order logic of graphs to directed treewidth. We show that most of the known positive algorithmic results for digraphs of constant directed treewidth can be reformulated in terms of our metatheorem. Additionally, we show how to use our metatheorem to provide polynomial time algorithms for two classes of combinatorial problems that have not yet been studied in the context of directed width measures. More precisely, for each fixed $k,w \in \mathbb{N}$, we show how to count in polynomial time on digraphs of directed treewidth $w$, the number of minimum spanning strong subgraphs that are the union of $k$ directed paths, and the number of maximal subgraphs that are the union of $k$ directed paths and satisfy a given minor closed property. To prove our metatheorem we devise two technical tools which we believe to be of independent interest. First, we introduce the notion of tree-zig-zag number of a digraph, a new directed width measure that is at most a constant times directed treewidth. Second, we introduce the notion of $z$-saturated tree slice language, a new formalism for the specification and manipulation of infinite sets of digraphs."

Results pertaining to the nodal patterns generated by arbitrary transmission radii on the plane are explored with a connection to broadcasting sequences and ap- proximation of discrete metrics of which results are given for the approximation of astroids, a previously unachievable concave metric, through a novel application of the aggregation of waves via a number of explored functions."

It is well known that the downward closure of any language is regular. Although the downward closure seems to be a promising abstraction, there are only few language classes for which an automaton for the downward closure is known to be computable.   It is shown here that for stacked counter automata, the downward closure is computable. Stacked counter automata are finite automata with a storage mechanism obtained by \emph{adding blind counters} and \emph{building stacks}. Hence, they generalize pushdown and blind counter automata.   The class of languages accepted by these automata are precisely those in the hierarchy obtained from the context-free languages by alternating two closure operators: imposing semilinear constraints and taking the algebraic extension. The main tool for computing downward closures is the new concept of Parikh annotations. As a second application of Parikh annotations, it is shown that the hierarchy above is strict at every level."

This mu-calculus contains extended time-modality operators and can express all of TCTL. Our algorithmic approach uses an ""on-the-fly"" strategy based on proof search as a means of ensuring high performance for both positive and negative answers to model-checking questions. In particular, a set of proof rules for solving model-checking problems are given and proved sound and complete; we encode our algorithm in these proof rules and model-check a property by constructing a proof (or showing none exists) using these rules. One noteworthy aspect of our technique is that we show that verification performance can be improved with \emph{derived rules}, whose correctness can be inferred from the more primitive rules on which they are based. In this paper, we give the basic proof rules underlying our method, describe derived proof rules to improve performance, and compare our implementation of this model checker to the UPPAAL tool."
2014-08-26 01:17:17+00:00,2014-08-26 01:17:17+00:00,"Games on recursive game graphs can be used to reason about the control flow of sequential programs with recursion. In games over recursive game graphs, the most natural notion of strategy is the modular strategy, i.e., a strategy that is local to a module and is oblivious to previous module invocations, and thus does not depend on the context of invocation. In this work, we study for the first time modular strategies with respect to winning conditions that can be expressed by a pushdown automaton.   We show that such games are undecidable in general, and become decidable for visibly pushdown automata specifications.   Our solution relies on a reduction to modular games with finite-state automata winning conditions, which are known in the literature.   We carefully characterize the computational complexity of the considered decision problem. In particular, we show that modular games with a universal Buchi or co Buchi visibly pushdown winning condition are EXPTIME-complete, and when the winning condition is given by a CARET or NWTL temporal logic formula the problem is 2EXPTIME-complete, and it remains 2EXPTIME-hard even for simple fragments of these logics.   As a further contribution, we present a different solution for modular games with finite-state automata winning condition that runs faster than known solutions for large specifications and many exits."

It is known that deciding the winner in reachability games on RTA is undecidable for automata with two or more clocks, while the problem is decidable for automata with only one clock. Ouaknine and Worrell recently proposed a time-bounded theory of real-time verification by claiming that restriction to bounded-time recovers decidability for several key decision problem related to real-time verification. We revisited games on recursive timed automata with time-bounded restriction in the hope of recovering decidability. However, we found that the problem still remains undecidable for recursive timed automata with three or more clocks. Using similar proof techniques we characterize a decidability frontier for a generalization of RTA to recursive stopwatch automata."

With expressive power comes complexity. Mio showed that tree games are able to encode Blackwell games and, consequently, are not determined under deterministic strategies.   We show that non-stochastic tree games with objectives recognisable by so-called game automata are determined under deterministic, finite memory strategies. Moreover, we give an elementary algorithmic procedure which, for an arbitrary regular language L and a finite non-stochastic tree game with a winning objective L decides if the game is determined under deterministic strategies."

For instance, timed automata were introduced as automata extended with clocks. In this paper, we study models of timed finite state machines (TFSMs), i.e., FSMs enriched with time, which accept timed input words and generate timed output words. Here we discuss some models of TFSMs with a single clock: TFSMs with timed guards, TFSMs with timeouts, and TFSMs with both timed guards and timeouts. We solve the problem of equivalence checking for all three models, and we compare their expressive power, characterizing subclasses of TFSMs with timed guards and of TFSMs with timeouts that are equivalent to each other."

While the existing notions are well-investigated concerning expressiveness, they all lack a proper notion of determinism, which makes it difficult to distinguish subclasses of automata for which problems such as inclusion, equivalence, and minimization can be solved efficiently. In this paper, we propose and investigate different notions of ""horizontal determinism"", starting from automata for unranked trees in which the horizontal evaluation is performed by finite state automata. We show that a restriction to confluent horizontal evaluation leads to polynomial-time emptiness and universality, but still suffers from coNP-completeness of the emptiness of binary intersections. Finally, efficient algorithms can be obtained by imposing an order of horizontal evaluation globally for all automata in the class. Depending on the choice of the order, we obtain different classes of automata, each of which has the same expressiveness as CMso."

We then introduce a new clock update for timed automata that allows hourglass automata to be expressed. This allows us to show that language emptiness remains decidable with this update when the number of clocks is two or less. This is done by showing that we can construct a finite untimed graph using clock regions from any timed automaton that use this new update."

In analogy to the case of monadic second-order logic of one successor, the considered synthesis problem receives as input an HSeq formula phi and a finite set Sigma of propositional variables and temporal requests, and it establishes whether or not, for all possible evaluations of elements in Sigma in every interval structure, there exists an evaluation of the remaining propositional variables and temporal requests such that the resulting structure is a model for phi. We focus our attention on decidability of the synthesis problem for some meaningful fragments of HSeq, whose modalities are drawn from the set A (meets), Abar (met by), B (begins), Bbar (begun by), interpreted over finite linear orders and natural numbers. We prove that the fragment ABBbareq is decidable (non-primitive recursive hard), while the fragment AAbarBBbar turns out to be undecidable. In addition, we show that even the synthesis problem for ABBbar becomes undecidable if we replace finite linear orders by natural numbers."

We consider the case of specifications that are deterministic top-down tree automatic, meaning the specification is recognizable by a deterministic top-down tree automaton that reads the two given trees synchronously in parallel. In this setting we study tree transducers that are allowed to have either bounded delay or arbitrary delay. Delay is caused whenever the transducer reads a symbol from the input tree but does not produce output. We provide decision procedures for both bounded and arbitrary delay that yield deterministic top-down tree transducers which realize the specification for valid input trees. Similar to the case of relations over words, we use two-player games to obtain our results."

We show that solutions of any ILP instance can be naturally represented by an FO-definable class of graphs. For each solution there may be many graphs representing it. However, one of these graphs is of path-width at most 2n, where n is the number of variables in the instance. Since FO is decidable on graphs of bounded path- width, we obtain an alternative decidability result for ILP. The technique we use underlines a common principle to prove decidability which has previously been employed for automata with auxiliary storage.

We study the hardness of finding short reset words. It is known that the exact version of the problem, i.e., finding the shortest reset word, is NP-hard and coNP-hard, and complete for the DP class, and that approximating the length of the shortest reset word within a factor of $O(\log n)$ is NP-hard [Gerbush and Heeringa, CIAA'10], even for the binary alphabet [Berlinkov, DLT'13]. We significantly improve on these results by showing that, for every $\epsilon>0$, it is NP-hard to approximate the length of the shortest reset word within a factor of $n^{1-\epsilon}$. This is essentially tight since a simple $O(n)$-approximation algorithm exists."

Our technique restricts the behavior of a Kripke-structure with labeled transitions, representing the uncontrolled system, such that it adheres to a given requirement specification in an expressive modal logic. while all non-invalidating behavior is retained. This induces maximal permissiveness in the context of supervisory control. Research presented in this paper allows a system model to be constrained according to a broad set of liveness, safety and fairness specifications of desired behavior, and embraces most concepts from Ramadge-Wonham supervisory control, including controllability and marker-state reachability. Synthesis is defined in this paper as a formal construction, which allowed a careful validation of its correctness using the Coq proof assistant."

The following results are obtained:   PRE can be simulated by the classical model of nondeterministic finite automata with sensing one-way heads. The number of heads depends on the number of different variables in the expressions.   A space bound O(n log m) for matching a text of length m with a PRE with n variables based on the previous simulation. This improves the bound O(nm) from (C\^ampeanu and Santean 2009).   PRE cannot be simulated by deterministic finite automata with at most three sensing one-way heads or deterministic finite automata with any number of non-sensing one-way heads.   PRE with a bounded number of occurrences of variables in any match can be simulated by nondeterministic finite automata with one-way heads.   There is a tight hierarchy of PRE with a growing number of non-nested variables over a fixed alphabet. A previously known hierarchy was based on nested variables and growing alphabets (Larsen 1998).   Matching of PRE without star over a single-letter alphabet is NP-complete. This strengthens the corresponding result for expressions over larger alphabets and with star (Aho 1990).   Inequivalence of PRE without closure operators is Sigma^P_2-complete.   The decidability of universality of PRE over a single letter alphabet is linked to the existence of Fermat Primes.   Greibach's Theorem applies to languages characterized by PRE."

The ability to efficiently analyze and describe image patterns is thus of fundamental importance. The study of syntactic methods of describing pictures has been of interest for researchers. Array Grammars can be used to represent and recognize connected patterns. In any image the patterns are recognized using connected patterns. It is very difficult to represent all connected patterns (CP) even on a small 3 x 3 neighborhood in a pictorial way. The present paper proposes the model of array grammar capable of generating any kind of simple or complex pattern and derivation of connected pattern in an image neighborhood using the proposed grammar is discussed.

The aim of GRAPHITE is to foster the convergence on research interests from several communities dealing with graph analysis in all its forms in computer science, with a particular attention to software development and analysis. Graphs are used to represent data and processes in many application areas, and they are subjected to various computational algorithms in order to analyze them. Just restricting the attention to the analysis of software, graph analysis algorithms are used, for instance, to verify properties using model checking techniques that explore the system's state space graph or static analysis techniques based on control flow graphs. Further application domains include games, planning, and network analysis. Very often, graph problems and their algorithmic solutions have common characteristics, independent of their application domain. The goal of this event is to gather scientists from different communities, who do research on graph analysis algorithms, such that awareness of each others' work is increased.

Action-labelled transitions are instantaneous and yield a distribution over states, whereas timed transitions impose a random delay governed by an exponential distribution. MAs are thus a nondeterministic variation of continuous-time Markov chains. MAs are compositional and are used to provide a semantics for engineering frameworks such as (dynamic) fault trees, (generalised) stochastic Petri nets, and the Architecture Analysis & Design Language (AADL). This paper considers the quantitative analysis of MAs. We consider three objectives: expected time, long-run average, and timed (interval) reachability. Expected time objectives focus on determining the minimal (or maximal) expected time to reach a set of states. Long-run objectives determine the fraction of time to be in a set of states when considering an infinite time horizon. Timed reachability objectives are about computing the probability to reach a set of states within a given time interval. This paper presents the foundations and details of the algorithms and their correctness proofs. We report on several case studies conducted using a prototypical tool implementation of the algorithms, driven by the MAPA modelling language for efficiently generating MAs."

Formally, such a hierarchical decomposition has the form of a straight-line linear context-free tree grammar of size $O\big(\frac{n}{\log_\sigma n}\big)$, which can be used as a compressed representation of the input tree. This generalizes an analogous result for strings. Previous grammar-based tree compressors were not analyzed for the worst-case size of the computed grammar, except for the top dag of Bille et al., for which only the weaker upper bound of $O\big(\frac{n}{\log_\sigma^{0.19} n}\big)$ (which was very recently improved to $O\big(\frac{n \cdot \log \log_\sigma n}{\log_\sigma n}\big)$ by H\""ubschle-Schneider and Raman) for unranked and unlabelled trees has been derived. The main result is used to show that every arithmetical formula of size $n$, in which only $m \leq n$ different variables occur, can be transformed (in linear time as well as in logspace) into an arithmetical circuit of size $O\big(\frac{n \cdot \log m}{\log n}\big)$ and depth $O(\log n)$.

This idea can be combined with already existing optimisations, and we show in particular a nice integration with the disjoint sets forest data-structure from Hopcroft and Karp's standard algorithm. Then we consider Kleene algebra with tests (KAT), an algebraic theory that can be used for verification in various domains ranging from compiler optimisation to network programming analysis. This theory is decidable by reduction to language equivalence of automata on guarded strings, a particular kind of automata that have exponentially large alphabets. We propose several methods allowing to construct symbolic automata out of KAT expressions, based either on Brzozowski's derivatives or standard automata constructions. All in all, this results in efficient algorithms for deciding equivalence of KAT expressions."
2014-07-06 16:26:57+00:00,2014-07-06 16:26:57+00:00,"Probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) are used to define distributions over strings, and are powerful modelling tools in a number of areas, including natural language processing, software engineering, model checking, bio-informatics, and pattern recognition. A common important question is that of comparing the distributions generated or modelled by these grammars: this is done through checking language equivalence and computing distances. Two PCFGs are language equivalent if every string has identical probability with both grammars. This also means that the distance (whichever norm is used) is null. It is known that the language equivalence problem is interreducible with that of multiple ambiguity for context-free grammars, a long-standing open question. In this work, we prove that computing distances corresponds to solving undecidable questions: this is the case for the L1, L2 norm, the variation distance and the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Two more results are less negative: 1. The most probable string can be computed, and, 2. The Chebyshev distance (where the distance between two distributions is the maximum difference of probabilities over all strings) is interreducible with the language equivalence problem."

Furthermore, PAFAs can recognize some nonregular unary languages, including the unary squares language, which seems to be difficult even for some classical counter automata with two-way input. Regarding quantum finite automata (QFAs), we show that the emptiness problem is undecidable both for universal QFAs on general alphabets, and for alternating QFAs with two alternations on unary alphabets. On the other hand, the same problem is decidable for nondeterministic QFAs on general alphabets. We also show that the unary squares language is recognized by alternating QFAs with two alternations."

In support of this theory, the list of undecidable problems recently shown decidable under time-bounded restriction is rather impressive: language inclusion for timed automata, emptiness problem for alternating timed automata, and emptiness problem for rectangular hybrid automata. The objective of our study was to recover decidability for general recursive timed automata---and perhaps for recursive hybrid automata---under time-bounded restriction in order to provide an appealing verification framework for powerful modeling environments such as Stateflow/Simulink. Unfortunately, however, we answer this question in negative by showing that time-bounded reachability problem stays undecidable for recursive timed automata with five or more clocks. While the bad news continues even when one considers well-behaved subclasses of recursive hybrid automata, we recover decidability by considering recursive hybrid automata with bounded context using a pass-by-reference mechanism, or by restricting the number of variables to two, with rates in $\{0,1\}$."

In the exact case, the observer can infer the current machine state after observing $L$ generated symbols with probability $1-a^L$ where $0 \leq a<1$ is a so-called synchronization rate constant. In the asymptotic case, the probability of the correct prediction the current machine state after observing $L$ generated symbols tends to $1$ exponentially fast as $1-b^L$ for $0<b<1$ and the infimum of such $b$ is a so-called prediction rate constant.   Hence the synchronization and prediction rate constants serve as natural measures of synchronization for $\epsilon$-machines. In the present work we show how to approximate these constants in polynomial time in terms of the number of machine states."

These results, as well as ours, exemplify the intricate connections between computation and geometry that can occur in self-assembly.   In this model, tiles can stick to an existing assembly as soon as one of their sides matches the existing assembly. This feature contrasts with the general cooperative model, where it can be required that tiles match on \emph{several} of their sides in order to bind.

The central problem studied in this paper is to determine the set of parameter valuations $V_{\prec p} (\varphi)$ for which the probability to satisfy pLTL-formula $\varphi$ in a Markov chain meets a given threshold $\prec p$, where $\prec$ is a comparison on reals and $p$ a probability. As for pLTL determining the emptiness of $V_{> 0}(\varphi)$ is undecidable, we consider several logic fragments.

Furthermore, we use an extension of Antimirov partial derivatives in order to solve the membership test in the general case.

As opposed to traditional verification, where one handles the question of whether a system satisfies, or not, a given specification, reasoning about quality addresses the question of \emph{how well} the system satisfies the specification. One direction in this effort is to refine the ""eventually"" operators of temporal logic to {\em discounting operators}: the satisfaction value of a specification is a value in $[0,1]$, where the longer it takes to fulfill eventuality requirements, the smaller the satisfaction value is.   In this paper we introduce an augmentation by discounting of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), and study it, as well as its combination with propositional quality operators. We show that one can augment LTL with an arbitrary set of discounting functions, while preserving the decidability of the model-checking problem. Further augmenting the logic with unary propositional quality operators preserves decidability, whereas adding an average-operator makes some problems undecidable. We also discuss the complexity of the problem, as well as various extensions."

The class of infinite words whose set of factors is in $L_k$ is denoted by $W_k$. In this paper we focus on the relations between the classes $W_k$ and the subword complexity of infinite words, which is as usual defined as the number of factors of the word of length $n$. In particular, we prove that the class $W_{2}$ coincides with the class of   infinite words of linear complexity.

We fill this gap by providing an in-depth analysis of the computational complexity of the aforementioned decision problems. Most interestingly, it turns out that while the addition of reset operations to ordinary VASS leads to undecidability and Ackermann-hardness of reachability and coverability, respectively, they can be added to ZVASS while retaining NP-completness of both coverability and reachability."

For this family, we show that even two-way nondeterminism does not help to save a single state. By comparing this with the corresponding state complexity of alternating machines, we then get a tight exponential gap between two-way nondeterministic and one-way alternating automata solving unary promise problems. Second, despite of the existing quadratic gap between Las Vegas realtime probabilistic automata and one-way deterministic automata for language recognition, we show that, by turning to promise problems, the tight gap becomes exponential. Last, we show that the situation is different for one-way probabilistic automata with two-sided bounded-error. We present a family of unary promise problems that is very easy for these machines; solvable with only two states, but the number of states in two-way alternating or any simpler automata is not limited by a constant.

We also propose a complementary error reporting strategy that may lead to better error messages: labeled failures. This approach is inspired by exception handling of programming languages, and lets a PEG define different kinds of failure, with each ordered choice operator specifying which kinds it catches.

In some cases minimization of DFA can lead to an exponential increase in BC-complexity, on the other hand BC-complexity of DFAs with a large state space which are obtained by some standard constructions (determinization of NFA, language operations), is reasonably small. But our main result is the analogue of the ""Shannon effect"" for finite automata: almost all DFAs with a fixed number of states have BC-complexity that is close to the maximum."

The theory for hyper-minimization of deterministic weighted tree automata is provided. The presence of weights slightly complicates the situation in comparison to the unweighted case. In addition, the first hyper-minimization algorithm for deterministic weighted tree automata, weighted over commutative semifields, is provided together with some implementation remarks that enable an efficient implementation. In fact, the same run-time O(m log n) as in the unweighted case is obtained, where m is the size of the deterministic weighted tree automaton and n is its number of states."

In recent years, extensions of ordinary simulations have been studied, for instance multi-pebble and multi-letter simulations which yield better approximations and are still polynomial-time computable.   In this paper we study the limitations of approximating language inclusion in this way: we introduce a natural extension of multi-letter simulations called buffered simulations. They are based on a simulation game in which the two players share a FIFO buffer of unbounded size. We consider two variants of these buffered games called continuous and look-ahead simulation which differ in how elements can be removed from the FIFO buffer. We show that look-ahead simulation, the simpler one, is already PSPACE-hard, i.e. computationally as hard as language inclusion itself. Continuous simulation is even EXPTIME-hard. We also provide matching upper bounds for solving these games with infinite state spaces."

We compare the obtained language families with those induced by deterministic finite automata with the same property. In some cases, it is shown that there is no difference in characterization between deterministic finite automata and biautomata as for the permutation-freeness, but there are also other cases, where it makes a big difference whether one considers deterministic finite automata or biautomata. This is, for instance, the case when comparing strongly permutation-freeness, which results in the family of definite language for deterministic finite automata, while biautomata induce the family of finite and co-finite languages. The obtained results nicely fall into the known landscape on classical language families."

The combined power of the succinctness of the representation of finite languages using both cover languages and non-determinism has been suggested, but never systematically studied.

Moreover, studying the dynamics of how rules emerge under artificial selection for function has recently become a powerful tool for understanding how evolution can innovate within its genetic rule space. However, conventional cellular automata lack the kind of state feedback that is surely present in natural evolving systems. Each new generation of a population leaves an indelible mark on its environment and thus affects the selective pressures that shape future generations of that population. To model this phenomenon, we have augmented traditional cellular automata with state-dependent feedback. Rather than generating automata executions from an initial condition and a static rule, we introduce mappings which generate iteration rules from the cellular automaton itself. We show that these new automata contain disconnected regions which locally act like conventional automata, thus encapsulating multiple functions into one structure. Consequently, we have provided a new model for processes like cell differentiation. Finally, by studying the size of these regions, we provide additional evidence that the dynamics of self-reference may be critical to understanding the evolution of natural language. In particular, the rules of elementary cellular automata appear to be distributed in the same way as words in the corpus of a natural language."

However, the smallest tree-counterexample may be exponential in the size of the target automaton. Thus the above algorithm does not run in time polynomial in the size of the target automaton, and has query complexity exponential in the lower bound.   Assuming a Teacher that returns minimal DAG representations of counterexamples, we give a new exact learning algorithm whose query complexity is quadratic in the target automaton size, almost matching the lower bound, and improving the best previously-known algorithm by an exponential factor."

The class of languages accepted by deterministic multipass automata is exactly the Boolean closure of the class of deterministic context-free languages while the class of languages accepted by nondeterministic multipass automata is exactly the class of poly-context-free languages, that is, languages which are the intersection of finitely many context-free languages. We illustrate the use of these automata by studying groups whose word problems are in the above classes."
2014-04-29 01:18:14+00:00,2014-10-27 15:36:45+00:00,"In this paper we describe a new tool, SReach, which solves probabilistic bounded reachability problems for two classes of stochastic hybrid systems. The first one is (nonlinear) hybrid automata with parametric uncertainty. The second one is probabilistic hybrid automata with additional randomness for both transition probabilities and variable resets. Standard approaches to reachability problems for linear hybrid systems require numerical solutions for large optimization problems, and become infeasible for systems involving both nonlinear dynamics over the reals and stochasticity. Our approach encodes stochastic information by using random variables, and combines the randomized sampling, a $\delta$-complete decision procedure, and statistical tests. SReach utilizes the $\delta$-complete decision procedure to solve reachability problems in a sound manner, i.e., it always decides correctly if, for a given assignment to all random variables, the system actually reaches the unsafe region. The statistical tests adapted guarantee arbitrary small error bounds between probabilities estimated by SReach and real ones. Compared to standard simulation-based methods, our approach supports non-deterministic branching, increases the coverage of simulation, and avoids the zero-crossing problem. We demonstrate our method's feasibility by applying SReach to three representative biological models and to additional benchmarks for nonlinear hybrid systems with multiple probabilistic system parameters."

Cerny conjectured in 1964 that if a n-state deterministic automaton has a synchronizing word, then it has a synchronizing word of size at most (n-1)^2. Berlinkov recently made a breakthrough in the probabilistic analysis of synchronization by proving that with high probability, an automaton has a synchronizing word. In this article, we prove that with high probability an automaton admits a synchronizing word of length smaller than n^(1+\epsilon), and therefore that the Cerny conjecture holds with high probability."

In this paper, we give a construction, which for any given timed automaton produces a timed bisimilar automaton with the least number of clocks.

We quantify input and output perturbation using similarity functions. We show that K-robustness is undecidable even for deterministic transducers. We identify a class of functional transducers, which admits a polynomial time automata-theoretic decision procedure for K-robustness. This class includes Mealy machines and functional letter-to-letter transducers. We also study K-robustness of nondeterministic transducers. Since a nondeterministic transducer generates a set of output words for each input word, we quantify output perturbation using set-similarity functions. We show that K-robustness of nondeterministic transducers is undecidable, even for letter-to-letter transducers.

As allowing for navigation wrt. tuples of data values renders the logic undecidable, we introduce ND-LTL, an extension of BD-LTL by a restricted form of tuple-navigation. While complete ND-LTL is still undecidable, the two natural fragments allowing for either future or past navigation along data values are shown to be Ackermann-hard, yet decidability is obtained by reduction to nested multi-counter systems. To this end, we introduce and study nested variants of data automata as an intermediate model simplifying the constructions. To complement these results we show that imposing the same restrictions on BD-LTL yields two 2ExpSpace-complete fragments while satisfiability for the full logic is known to be as hard as reachability in Petri nets."

The second model is a {\em Weighted Context-Free Grammar }(\WCFG) frequently used for natural language processing. \PB and \WCFG encode local and non-local interactions respectively, and thus can be viewed as complementary.   We propose a {\em Grammatical Pattern-Based CRF model }(\GPB) that combines the two in a natural way. We argue that it has certain advantages over existing approaches such as the {\em Hybrid model} of Bened{\'i} and Sanchez that combines {\em $\mbox{$N$-grams}$} and \WCFGs.

Here is a summary of our results:   - There is a promise problem solvable by an exact two-way QFA in exponential expected time, but not by any bounded-error sublogarithmic space probabilistic Turing machine (PTM).   - There is a promise problem solvable by an exact two-way QFA in quadratic expected time, but not by any bounded-error $ o(\log \log n) $-space PTMs in polynomial expected time. The same problem can be solvable by a one-way Las Vegas (or exact two-way) QFA with quantum head in linear (expected) time.   - There is a promise problem solvable by a Las Vegas realtime QFA, but not by any bounded-error realtime PFA. The same problem can be solvable by an exact two-way QFA in linear expected time but not by any exact two-way PFA.   - There is a family of promise problems such that each promise problem can be solvable by a two-state exact realtime QFAs, but, there is no such bound on the number of states of realtime bounded-error PFAs solving the members this family.   Our results imply that there exist zero-error quantum computational devices with a \emph{single qubit} of memory that cannot be simulated by any finite memory classical computational model. This provides a computational perspective on results regarding ontological theories of quantum mechanics \cite{Hardy04}, \cite{Montina08}. As a consequence we find that classical automata based simulation models \cite{Kleinmann11}, \cite{Blasiak13} are not sufficiently powerful to simulate quantum contextuality. We conclude by highlighting the interplay between results from automata models and their application to developing a general framework for quantum contextuality."

We prove that conditional normality is a stronger condition than conditional (strong) relative observability, hence conditional strong relative observability can be used in coordination control instead of conditional normality, and present a distributive procedure for the computation of a conditionally controllable and conditionally observable sublanguage of the specification that contains the supremal conditionally strong relative observable sublanguage."

For examples, it has been believed that quantum tools can provide significant, that is larger than polynomial, advantages in the case of exact quantum computation only, or mainly, for problems with very special structures. We will show that this is not the case.   In this paper the potential of quantum finite automata producing outcomes not only with a (high) probability, but with certainty (so called exactly) is explored in the context of their uses for solving promise problems and with respect to the size of automata. It is shown that for solving particular classes $\{A^n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ of promise problems, even those without some very special structure, that succinctness of the exact quantum finite automata under consideration, with respect to the number of (basis) states, can be very small (and constant) though it grows proportional to $n$ in the case deterministic finite automata (DFAs) of the same power are used. This is here demonstrated also for the case that the component languages of the promise problems solvable by DFAs are non-regular. The method used can be applied in finding more exact quantum finite automata or quantum algorithms for other promise problems."

Apart from the inherent simplicity, Schewe's construction improved Safra's construction (which requires $12^nn^{2n}$ states). However, the price that is paid is the use of $2^{n-1}$ Rabin pairs (instead of $n$ in Safra's construction). Further, by introducing the \emph{later introduction record} as a record tailored for ordered trees, deterministic automata with Parity acceptance condition is constructed which exactly resembles Piterman's determinization with Parity acceptance condition where the state complexity is $O((n!)^2)$ and the index complexity is $2n$.In this paper, we improve Schewe's construction to $2^{\lceil (n-1)/2\rceil}$ Rabin pairs with the same state complexity.

In the particular context of controller synthesis for quantitative specifications, the usual problem is to devise a strategy for a reactive system which yields some desired performance, taking into account the possible impact of the environment of the system. There are at least two ways to look at this environment. In the classical analysis of two-player quantitative games, the environment is purely antagonistic and the problem is to provide strict performance guarantees. In Markov decision processes, the environment is seen as purely stochastic: the aim is then to optimize the expected payoff, with no guarantee on individual outcomes.   In this expository work, we report on recent results introducing the beyond worst-case synthesis problem, which is to construct strategies that guarantee some quantitative requirement in the worst-case while providing an higher expected value against a particular stochastic model of the environment given as input. This problem is relevant to produce system controllers that provide nice expected performance in the everyday situation while ensuring a strict (but relaxed) performance threshold even in the event of very bad (while unlikely) circumstances. It has been studied for both the mean-payoff and the shortest path quantitative measures."

Many languages exploit (indirect) encodings of Turing Machines to demonstrate their ability to support arbitrary computation. However, these encodings are usually by simulating the entire Turing Machine within the language, or by encoding a language that does an encoding or simulation itself. This second category is typical for process calculi that show an encoding of lambda-calculus (often with restrictions) that in turn simulates a Turing Machine. Such approaches lead to indirect encodings of Turing Machines that are complex, unclear, and only weakly equivalent after computation. This paper presents an approach to encoding Turing Machines into intensional process calculi that is faithful, reduction preserving, and structurally equivalent. The encoding is demonstrated in a simple asymmetric concurrent pattern calculus before generalised to simplify infinite terms, and to show encodings into Concurrent Pattern Calculus and Psi Calculi."

We give an interpretation of the corresponding theorem for the class of displacement context-free languages which are equivalent to well-nested multiple context-free languages. We also obtain a characterization of k-displacement context-free languages in terms of monoid automata and show how such automata can be simulated on two stacks. We introduce the simultaneous two-stack automata and compare different variants of its definition. All the definitions considered are shown to be equivalent basing on the geometric interpretation of memory operations of these automata.

In particular, we study the problem of measuring the behavioral dissimilarity of two SMMs against linear real-time specifications expressed as Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas or Deterministic Timed-Automata (DTA). The most natural choice for such a distance is the one that measures the maximal difference that can be observed comparing two SMMs with respect to their probability of satisfying an arbitrary specification. We show that computing this metric is NP-hard. In addition, we show that any algorithm that approximates the distance within a certain absolute error, depending on the size of the SMMs, is NP-hard. Nevertheless, we introduce an alternative distance, based on the Kantorovich metric, that is an over-approximation of the former and we show that, under mild assumptions on the residence time distributions, it can be computed in polynomial time."

(or equivalently, to finite sets of matrices in K^nxn.) Let us call a matrix A location-synchronizing if there exists a column in A consisting of nonzero entries such that all the other columns of A are filled by zeros. If additionally all the entries of this designated column are the same, we call A synchronizing. Note that these notions coincide for stochastic matrices and also in the Boolean semiring. A set M of matrices in K^nxn is called (location-)synchronizing if M generates a matrix subsemigroup containing a (location-)synchronizing matrix. The K-(location-)synchronizability problem is the following: given a finite set M of nxn matrices with entries in K, is it (location-)synchronizing?   Both problems are PSPACE-hard for any nontrivial semiring. We give sufficient conditions for the semiring K when the problems are PSPACE-complete and show several undecidability results as well, e.g. synchronizability is undecidable if 1 has infinite order in (K,+,0) or when the free semigroup on two generators can be embedded into (K,*,1)."

The algorithm works for arbitrary size alphabets, but the running time is linear assuming that the alphabet Sigma of the input string can be identified with numbers from 1,ldots, N^c for some constant c. Algorithms with such an approximation guarantee and running time are known, however all of them were non-trivial and their analyses were involved. The here presented algorithm computes the LZ77 factorisation and transforms it in phases to a grammar. In each phase it maintains an LZ77-like factorisation of the word with at most l factors as well as additional O(l) letters, where l was the size of the original LZ77 factorisation. In one phase in a greedy way (by a left-to-right sweep and a help of the factorisation) we choose a set of pairs of consecutive letters to be replaced with new symbols, i.e. nonterminals of the constructed grammar. We choose at least 2/3 of the letters in the word and there are O(l) many different pairs among them. Hence there are O(log N) phases, each of them introduces O(l) nonterminals to a grammar. A more precise analysis yields a bound O(l log(N/l)). As l \leq g, this yields the desired bound O(g log(N/g))."

Existence of a subset reset word is known to be PSPACE-complete; we show that this holds even under the restriction to strongly connected binary automata.

We discuss different interpretations of uncertainty in the models which are studied in the literature and that result in two different definitions of bisimulations.

Udpda are a simple computation model that accept exactly the unary regular languages, but can be exponentially more succinct than finite-state automata. We complete the complexity landscape for udpda by showing that emptiness (and thus universality) is P-hard, equivalence and compressed membership problems are P-complete, and inclusion is coNP-complete. Our upper bounds are based on a translation theorem between udpda and straight-line programs over the binary alphabet (SLPs). We show that the characteristic sequence of any udpda can be represented as a pair of SLPs---one for the prefix, one for the lasso---that have size linear in the size of the udpda and can be computed in polynomial time. Hence, decision problems on udpda are reduced to decision problems on SLPs. Conversely, any SLP can be converted in logarithmic space into a udpda, and this forms the basis for our lower bound proofs. We show coNP-hardness of the ordered matching problem for SLPs, from which we derive coNP-hardness for inclusion. In addition, we complete the complexity landscape for unary nondeterministic pushdown automata by showing that the universality problem is $\Pi_2 \mathrm P$-hard, using a new class of integer expressions. Our techniques have applications beyond udpda. We show that our results imply $\Pi_2 \mathrm P$-completeness for a natural fragment of Presburger arithmetic and coNP lower bounds for compressed matching problems with one-character wildcards."

We first derive incomplete state machines from the given scenarios, and then synthesis corresponds to completing the transition relation of individual processes so that the global product meets the specified requirements. This completion problem, in general, has the same complexity, PSPACE, as the verification problem, but unlike the verification problem, is NP-complete for a constant number of processes. We present two algorithms for solving the completion problem, one based on a heuristic search in the space of possible completions and one based on OBDD-based symbolic fixpoint computation. We evaluate the proposed methodology for protocol specification and the effectiveness of the synthesis algorithms using the classical alternating-bit protocol."

Recently, RPQs have been extended by Libkin and Vrgo$\rm \check{c}$ to incorporate data value comparisons among different nodes on paths, called regular path queries with data (RDPQ). It has been shown that the evaluation problem of RDPQs is PSPACE-complete and NLOGSPACE-complete in data complexity. On the other hand, the containment problem of RDPQs is in general undecidable. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to extend regular path queries with data value comparisons, called rigid regular path queries with data (RRDPQ). The main ingredient of this approach is an automata model called nondeterministic rigid register automata (NRRA), in which the data value comparisons are \emph{rigid}, in the sense that if the data value in the current position $x$ is compared to a data value in some other position $y$, then by only using the labels (but not data values), the position $y$ can be uniquely determined from $x$. We show that NRRAs are robust in the sense that nondeterministic, deterministic and two-way variant of NRRAs, as well as an extension of regular expressions, are all of the same expressivity. We then argue that the expressive power of RDPQs are reasonable by demonstrating that for every graph database, there is a localized transformation of the graph database so that every RDPQ in the original graph database can be turned into an equivalent RRDPQ over the transformed one. Finally, we investigate the computational properties of RRDPQs and conjunctive RRDPQs (CRRDPQ). In particular, we show that the containment of CRRDPQs (and RRDPQs) can be decided in 2EXPSPACE."

Unlike most complexity functions, cyclic complexity distinguishes between Sturmian words of different slopes. We prove that if $x$ is a Sturmian word and $y$ is a word having the same cyclic complexity of $x,$ then up to renaming letters, $x$ and $y$ have the same set of factors. In particular, $y$ is also Sturmian of slope equal to that of $x.$ Since $c_x(n)=1$ for some $n\geq 1$ implies $x$ is periodic, it is natural to consider the quantity $\liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty} c_x(n).$ We show that if $x$ is a Sturmian word, then $\liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty} c_x(n)=2.$ We prove however that this is not a characterization of Sturmian words by exhibiting a restricted class of Toeplitz words, including the period-doubling word, which also verify this same condition on the limit infimum. In contrast we show that, for the Thue-Morse word $t$, $\liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty} c_t(n)=+\infty.$"

For nondeterministic automatic complexity we show $I(\mathbf t)=1/2$. We prove that such complexity $A_N$ of a word $x$ of length $n$ satisfies $A_N(x)\le b(n):=\lfloor n/2\rfloor + 1$. This enables us to define the complexity deficiency $D(x)=b(n)-A_N(x)$. If $x$ is square-free then $D(x)=0$. If $x$ almost square-free in the sense of Fraenkel and Simpson, or if $x$ is a strongly cube-free binary word such as the infinite Thue word, then $D(x)\le 1$. On the other hand, there is no constant upper bound on $D$ for strongly cube-free words in a ternary alphabet, nor for cube-free words in a binary alphabet.

In this paper, we introduce a new quantum pushdown automaton model that has a garbage tape. This model can overcome the reversibility restriction by exploiting the garbage tape to store popped symbols. We show that the proposed model can simulate any quantum pushdown automaton with a classical stack as well as any probabilistic pushdown automaton. We also show that our model can solve a certain promise problem exactly while deterministic pushdown automata cannot. These results imply that our model is strictly more powerful than classical counterparts in the setting of exact, one-sided error and non-deterministic computation."

The slave automaton for $G\psi$ is in charge of recognizing whether $FG\psi$ holds. As opposed to standard determinization procedures, the states of all our automata have a clear logical structure, which allows to apply various optimizations. Our construction subsumes former algorithms for fragments of LTL. Experimental results show improvement in the sizes of the resulting automata compared to existing methods."

We prove that in order to answer this question, sufficient information can be extracted from semigroups recognizing the input languages, using a fixpoint computation. This yields an EXPTIME algorithm for checking first-order separability. Moreover, the correctness proof of this algorithm yields a stronger result, namely a description of a possible separator.

The notion of regularity for such functions has been defined using two-way finite-state transducers, (one-way) cost register automata, and MSO-definable graph transformations. In this paper, we give an algebraic and machine-independent characterization of this class analogous to the definition of regular languages by regular expressions. When the monoid is commutative, we prove that every regular function can be constructed from constant functions using the combinators of choice, split sum, and iterated sum, that are analogs of union, concatenation, and Kleene-*, respectively, but enforce unique (or unambiguous) parsing. Our main result is for the general case of non-commutative monoids, which is of particular interest for capturing regular string-to-string transformations for document processing. We prove that the following additional combinators suffice for constructing all regular functions: (1) the left-additive versions of split sum and iterated sum, which allow transformations such as string reversal; (2) sum of functions, which allows transformations such as copying of strings; and (3) function composition, or alternatively, a new concept of chained sum, which allows output values from adjacent blocks to mix."

Further, we show that the probability of all zero-reaching runs can be effectively approximated up to an arbitrarily small given error epsilon > 0 in time which is polynomial in log(epsilon), exponential in the size of a given pMC, and doubly exponential in the number of counters.

2014-01-24 16:42:20+00:00,2016-11-21 11:23:48+00:00,"The last decade has witnessed significant attention on networked control systems (NCS) due to their ubiquitous presence in industrial applications, and, in the particular case of wireless NCS, because of their architectural flexibility and low installation and maintenance costs. In wireless NCS the communication between sensors, controllers, and actuators is supported by a communication channel that is likely to introduce variable communication delays, packet losses, limited bandwidth, and other practical non-idealities leading to numerous technical challenges. Although stability properties of NCS have been investigated extensively in the literature, results for NCS under more complex and general objectives, and in particular results dealing with verification or controller synthesis for logical specifications, are much more limited. This work investigates how to address such complex objectives by constructively deriving symbolic models of NCS, while encompassing the mentioned network non-idealities. The obtained abstracted (symbolic) models can then be employed to synthesize hybrid controllers enforcing rich logical specifications over the concrete NCS models. Examples of such general specifications include properties expressed as formulae in linear temporal logic (LTL) or as automata on infinite strings. We thus provide a general synthesis framework that can be flexibly adapted to a number of NCS setups. We illustrate the effectiveness of the results over some case studies."

Stacks that fit the shape constraint may reach arbitrary heights; further a process may execute any communication action (be it process creation, message send or retrieval) whether or not its stack is empty. This class extends previous computational models studied in the context of asynchronous programs, and enables the safety verification of a large class of message passing programs."

Given an integer $k<=n$, the SIMPLE $k$-PATH problem asks whether there exists a simple $k$-path in $G$. In case $G$ is weighted, the MIN-WT SIMPLE $k$-PATH problem asks for a simple $k$-path in $G$ of minimal weight. The fastest currently known deterministic algorithm for MIN-WT SIMPLE $k$-PATH by Fomin, Lokshtanov and Saurabh runs in time $O(2.851^k\cdot n^{O(1)}\cdot \log W)$ for graphs with integer weights in the range $[-W,W]$. This is also the best currently known deterministic algorithm for SIMPLE k-PATH- where the running time is the same without the $\log W$ factor. We define $L_k(n)\subseteq [n]^k$ to be the set of words of length $k$ whose symbols are all distinct. We show that an explicit construction of a non-deterministic automaton (NFA) of size $f(k)\cdot n^{O(1)}$ for $L_k(n)$ implies an algorithm of running time $O(f(k)\cdot n^{O(1)}\cdot \log W)$ for MIN-WT SIMPLE $k$-PATH when the weights are non-negative or the constructed NFA is acyclic as a directed graph. We show that the algorithm of Kneis et al. and its derandomization by Chen et al. for SIMPLE $k$-PATH can be used to construct an acylic NFA for $L_k(n)$ of size $O^*(4^{k+o(k)})$.   We show, on the other hand, that any NFA for $L_k(n)$ must be size at least $2^k$. We thus propose closing this gap and determining the smallest NFA for $L_k(n)$ as an interesting open problem that might lead to faster algorithms for MIN-WT SIMPLE $k$-PATH.   We use a relation between SIMPLE $k$-PATH and non-deterministic xor automata (NXA) to give another direction for a deterministic algorithm with running time $O^*(2^k)$ for SIMPLE $k$-PATH."

Utterance verification in this work implies the ability to determine when portions of a hypothesized word string correspond to incorrectly decoded vocabulary words or out-of-vocabulary words that may appear in an utterance. This capability is implemented here as a likelihood ratio (LR). There are two UV techniques that are presented here. The first is voice verification along with the vocabulary testing, at the same time the parameters for UV models are generated based on the optimization criterion which is directly related to the LR measure. The second technique is a pitch recognition based on weighted finite-state transducers. These transducers provide a common and natural representation for major components of speech recognition systems, including hidden Markov models (HMMs), context-dependency models, pronunciation dictionaries, statistical grammars, and word or phone lattices. The finite state machine processes the acoustic parameters of UV models. The results of an experimental study presented in the paper shows that LR based parameter estimation results in a significant improvement in UV performance for this task. The study also found that the use of the LR based weighted finite-state transducers along with the UV, can provide as much as an 11% improvement in UV performance when compared to existing UV procedures. Finally, it was also found that the performance of the finite state machine was highly dependent on the use of the LR criterion in training acoustic models. Several observations are made in the paper concerning the formation of confidence measures for UV and the interaction of these techniques with statistical language models."

We show that the generic language semantics for T-automata correctly instantiates the usual language semantics for a number of known classes of machines/languages, including regular, context-free, recursively-enumerable and various subclasses of context free languages (e.g. deterministic and real-time ones).

However, it is not immediately obvious whether it is possible to adapt Buchi's argument to establish equivalence between expressivity in S1S over element and successor and its existential fragment. In this paper we show that it is not: the existential fragment of S1S over element and successor is strictly less expressive, and is in fact equivalent to the co-Buchi languages."

The class of languages recognisable by unambiguous tree automata is still not well-understood. In particular, decidability of the problem whether a given language is recognisable by some unambiguous automaton is open. Moreover, there are no known upper bounds on the descriptive complexity of unambiguous languages among all regular tree languages.   In this paper we show the following complexity collapse: if a non-deterministic parity tree automaton $A$ is unambiguous and its priorities are between $i$ and $2n$ then the language recognised by $A$ is in the class $Comp(i+1,2n)$. A particular case of this theorem is for $i=n=1$: if $A$ is an unambiguous Buchi tree automaton then $L(A)$ is recognisable by a weak alternating automaton (or equivalently definable in weak MSO). The main motivation for this result is a theorem by Finkel and Simonnet stating that every unambiguous Buchi automaton recognises a Borel language.   The assumptions of the presented theorem are syntactic (we require one automaton to be both unambiguous and of particular parity index). However, to the authors' best knowledge this is the first theorem showing a collapse of the parity index that exploits the fact that a given automaton is unambiguous."
2014-01-16 09:43:11+00:00,2014-02-12 05:57:39+00:00,"A discounted-sum automaton (NDA) is a nondeterministic finite automaton with edge weights, valuing a run by the discounted sum of visited edge weights. More precisely, the weight in the i-th position of the run is divided by $\lambda^i$, where the discount factor $\lambda$ is a fixed rational number greater than 1. The value of a word is the minimal value of the automaton runs on it. Discounted summation is a common and useful measuring scheme, especially for infinite sequences, reflecting the assumption that earlier weights are more important than later weights. Unfortunately, determinization of NDAs, which is often essential in formal verification, is, in general, not possible. We provide positive news, showing that every NDA with an integral discount factor is determinizable. We complete the picture by proving that the integers characterize exactly the discount factors that guarantee determinizability: for every nonintegral rational discount factor $\lambda$, there is a nondeterminizable $\lambda$-NDA. We also prove that the class of NDAs with integral discount factors enjoys closure under the algebraic operations min, max, addition, and subtraction, which is not the case for general NDAs nor for deterministic NDAs. For general NDAs, we look into approximate determinization, which is always possible as the influence of a word's suffix decays. We show that the naive approach, of unfolding the automaton computations up to a sufficient level, is doubly exponential in the discount factor. We provide an alternative construction for approximate determinization, which is singly exponential in the discount factor, in the precision, and in the number of states. We also prove matching lower bounds, showing that the exponential dependency on each of these three parameters cannot be avoided. All our results hold equally for automata over finite words and for automata over infinite words."

In particular, if a language and its complement are recognised by {\omega}B- (resp. {\omega}S)-automata then the language is {\omega}-regular. The result is especially interesting because, as shown by Boja\'nczyk and Colcombet, {\omega}B-regular languages are complements of {\omega}S-regular languages. Therefore, the above theorem shows that these are two mutually dual classes that both have the separation property. Usually (e.g. in descriptive set theory or recursion theory) exactly one class from a pair C, Cc has the separation property. The proof technique reduces the separation property for {\omega}-word languages to profinite languages using Ramsey's theorem and topological methods. After that reduction, the analysis of the separation property in the profinite monoid is relatively simple. The whole construction is technically not complicated, moreover it seems to be quite extensible. The paper uses a framework for the analysis of B- and S-regular languages in the context of the profinite monoid that was proposed by Toru\'nczyk."

Typically, those techniques generate non-deterministic finite state automata, which can be determinized at a possibly exponential cost. Recent results show multiple advantages of using deterministic automata in symbolic and bounded model checking of LTL safety properties. In this paper, we present a technique with a supporting tool that takes a sequential extended regular expression specification {\Phi}, and a logic design implementation S, and generates a sequential circuit C, expressed as an And-Inverted-Graph, that checks whether S satisfies {\Phi}. The technique passes the generated circuit C to ABC, a bounded model checker, to validate correctness. We use free input variables to encode the non- determinism in {\Phi} and we obtain a number of states in miter linear in the size of {\Phi}. Our technique succeeds to generate the input to the model checker while other techniques fail because of the exponential blowup, and in most cases, ABC succeeds to either find defects in the design that was otherwise uncheckable, or validate the design. We evaluated our technique against several industrial benchmarks including the IBM arbiter, a load balancer, and a traffic light system, and compared our results with the NuSMV framework.

We revisit this language class with emphasis on notion of unambiguity and develop on the concept of Deterministic Logics for UL. The formulas of deterministic logics uniquely parse a word in order to evaluate satisfaction. We show that several deterministic logics robustly characterize UL. Moreover, we derive constructive reductions from these logics to the po2DFA automata. These reductions also allow us to show NP-complete satisfaction complexity for the deterministic logics considered.   Logics such as TL[F,P], FO2[<] are not deterministic and have been shown to characterize UL using algebraic methods. However there has been no known constructive reduction from these logics to po2DFA. We use deterministic logics to bridge this gap. The language-equivalent po2DFA for a given TL[F,P] formula is constructed and we analyze its size relative to the size of the TL[F,P] formula.

The specificity of cost functions is that exact values are not considered, but only estimated. In this paper, we define an extension of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) over finite words to describe cost functions. We give an explicit translation from this new logic to two dual form of cost automata, and we show that the natural decision problems for this logic are PSPACE-complete, as it is the case in the classical setting. We then algebraically characterize the expressive power of this logic, using a new syntactic congruence for cost functions introduced in this paper."

This semigroup is isomorphic to the transition semigroup of the minimal deterministic finite automaton accepting the language, that is, to the semigroup generated by transformations induced by non-empty words on the set of states of the automaton. In this paper we search for the largest syntactic semigroup of a star-free language having $n$ left quotients; equivalently, we look for the largest transition semigroup of an aperiodic finite automaton with $n$ states.   We introduce two new aperiodic transition semigroups. The first is generated by transformations that change only one state; we call such transformations and resulting semigroups unitary. In particular, we study complete unitary semigroups which have a special structure, and we show that each maximal unitary semigroup is complete. For $n \ge 4$ there exists a complete unitary semigroup that is larger than any aperiodic semigroup known to date.   We then present even larger aperiodic semigroups, generated by transformations that map a non-empty subset of states to a single state; we call such transformations and semigroups semiconstant. In particular, we examine semiconstant tree semigroups which have a structure based on full binary trees. The semiconstant tree semigroups are at present the best candidates for largest aperiodic semigroups.   We also prove that $2^n-1$ is an upper bound on the state complexity of reversal of star-free languages, and resolve an open problem about a special case of state complexity of concatenation of star-free languages."

We prove that the class of $\mathcal C$-graph automatic groups is closed under change of generating set, direct and free product for certain classes $\mathcal C$. We show that for quasi-realtime counter-graph automatic groups where normal forms have length that is linear in the geodesic length, there is an algorithm to compute normal forms (and therefore solve the word problem) in polynomial time. The class of quasi-realtime counter-graph automatic groups includes all Baumslag-Solitar groups, and the free group of countably infinite rank.

In this work, we propose the node coverage game, a two player turn-based game played on a finite game graph, as a formalization of the problem to test such systems. Each node in the graph represents a {\em functional equivalence class} of the software under test (SUT). One player, the tester, wants to maximize the node coverage, measured by the number of nodes visited when exploring the game graphs, while his opponent, the SUT, wants to minimize it. An optimal test would maximize the cover, and it is an interesting problem to find the maximal number of nodes that the tester can guarantee to visit, irrespective of the responses of the SUT. We show that the decision problem of whether the guarantee is less than a given number is NP-complete. Then we present techniques for testing nondeterministic SUTs with existing test suites for deterministic models. Finally, we report our implementation and experiments."

Unfortunately, all known algorithms give universal 2-tag systems that have a large number of symbols. In this work, tag systems with only 2 symbols (the minimum possible) are proved universal via an intricate construction showing that they simulate cyclic tag systems. Our simulation algorithm has a polynomial time overhead, and thus shows that binary tag systems simulate Turing machines in polynomial time.   We immediately find applications of our result. We reduce the halting problem for binary tag systems to the Post correspondence problem for 4 pairs of words. This improves on 7 pairs, the previous bound for undecidability in this problem. Following our result, only the case for 3 pairs of words remains open, as the problem is known to be decidable for 2 pairs. As a further application, we find that the matrix mortality problem is undecidable for sets with five $3\times 3$ matrices and for sets with two $15\times 15$ matrices.

The proof is based on a (polynomial) reduction from the reachability problem of reset (or lossy) counter machines, for which the Ackermann-hardness has been shown by Schnoebelen (2010); in fact, this reachability problem is known to be Ackermann-complete in the hierarchy of fast-growing complexity classes defined by Schmitz (2013)."

Thus, any computational architecture needs to show how it could relate to Turing machines and how stable implementations of Turing computation are possible. In this chapter, we implement universal Turing computation in a neural field environment. To this end, we employ the canonical symbologram representation of a Turing machine obtained from a G\""odel encoding of its symbolic repertoire and generalized shifts. The resulting nonlinear dynamical automaton (NDA) is a piecewise affine-linear map acting on the unit square that is partitioned into rectangular domains. Instead of looking at point dynamics in phase space, we then consider functional dynamics of probability distributions functions (p.d.f.s) over phase space. This is generally described by a Frobenius-Perron integral transformation that can be regarded as a neural field equation over the unit square as feature space of a dynamic field theory (DFT). Solving the Frobenius-Perron equation yields that uniform p.d.f.s with rectangular support are mapped onto uniform p.d.f.s with rectangular support, again.

It is a natural generalization of the longest common prefix (LCP) problem for regular words, for which an $O(n)$ preprocessing time and $O(1)$ query time solution exists.   Recently an efficient algorithm for this problem has been given by F. Blanchet-Sadri and J. Lazarow (LATA 2013). The preprocessing time was $O(nh+n)$, where $h$ is the number of ""holes"" in $w$. The algorithm was designed for partial words over a constant alphabet and was quite involved.   We present a simple solution to this problem with slightly better runtime that works for any linearly-sortable alphabet.

For such applications, mostly a special class of CA, called as linear/additive CA, have been utilized. Since linear/additive CA refer a limited number of candidate CA, while searching for solution to a problem, the best result may not be expected. The nonlinear CA can be a better alternative to linear/additive CA for achieving desired solutions in different applications. However, the nonlinear CA are yet to be characterized to fit the design for modeling an application. This work targets characterization of the nonlinear CA to utilize the huge search space of nonlinear CA while developing applications in VLSI domain. An analytical framework is developed to explore the properties of CA rules. The characterization is directed to deal with the reversibility, as the reversible CA are primarily targeted for VLSI applications. The reported characterization enables us to design two algorithms of linear time complexities -- one for identification and nother for synthesis of nonlinear reversible CA.

An infinite word $u$ on a $d$-ary alphabet has the WELLDOC property if, for each factor $w$ of $u$, positive integer $m$, and vector $\mathbf v\in\mathbb Z_{m}^{d}$, there is an occurrence of $w$ such that the Parikh vector of the prefix of $u$ preceding such occurrence is congruent to $\mathbf v$ modulo $m$.

2013-11-15 12:31:14+00:00,2014-06-19 19:22:40+00:00,"The framework of Hybrid automata, introduced by Alur, Courcourbetis, Henzinger, and Ho, provides a formal modeling and analysis environment to analyze the interaction between the discrete and the continuous parts of cyber-physical systems. Hybrid automata can be considered as generalizations of finite state automata augmented with a finite set of real-valued variables whose dynamics in each state is governed by a system of ordinary differential equations. Moreover, the discrete transitions of hybrid automata are guarded by constraints over the values of these real-valued variables, and enable discontinuous jumps in the evolution of these variables. Singular hybrid automata are a subclass of hybrid automata where dynamics is specified by state-dependent constant vectors. Henzinger, Kopke, Puri, and Varaiya showed that for even very restricted subclasses of singular hybrid automata, the fundamental verification questions, like reachability and schedulability, are undecidable. In this paper we present \emph{weak singular hybrid automata} (WSHA), a previously unexplored subclass of singular hybrid automata, and show the decidability (and the exact complexity) of various verification questions for this class including reachability (NP-Complete) and LTL model-checking (PSPACE-Complete). We further show that extending WSHA with a single unrestricted clock or extending WSHA with unrestricted variable updates lead to undecidability of reachability problem."

Two automata are equivalent if and only if they accept each word with the same probability. On the other side, in the process algebra community, probabilistic automata were re-proposed by Segala in 1995 which are more general than Rabin's automata. Bisimulations have been proposed for Segala's automata to characterize the equivalence between them. So far the two notions of equivalences and their characteristics have been studied most independently. In this paper, we consider Segala's automata, and propose a novel notion of distribution based bisimulation by joining the existing equivalence and bisimilarities. Our bisimulation bridges the two closely related concepts in the community, and provides a uniform way of studying their characteristics. We demonstrate the utility of our definition by studying distribution based bisimulation metrics, which gives rise to a robust notion of equivalence for Rabin's automata."

We investigate this basic question in this paper for $Dyck(s)$. $Dyck(s)$ is a fundamental context free grammar representing the language of well-balanced parentheses with s different types of parentheses and has played a pivotal role in the development of theory of context free languages. Computing edit distance to $Dyck(s)$ significantly generalizes string edit distance problem and has numerous applications ranging from repairing semi-structured documents such as XML to memory checking, automated compiler optimization, natural language processing etc.   In this paper we give the first near-linear time algorithm for edit distance computation to $Dyck(s)$ that achieves a nontrivial approximation factor of $O(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\log{OPT}(\log{n})^{\frac{1}{\epsilon}})$ in $O(n^{1+\epsilon}\log{n})$ time. In fact, given there exists an algorithm for computing string edit distance on input of size $n$ in $\alpha(n)$ time with $\beta(n)$-approximation factor, we can devise an algorithm for edit distance problem to $Dyck(s)$ running in $\tilde{O}(n^{1+\epsilon}+\alpha(n))$ and achieving an approximation factor of $O(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\beta(n)\log{OPT})$.   We show that the framework for efficiently approximating edit distance to $Dyck(s)$ can be applied to many other languages. We illustrate this by considering various memory checking languages which comprise of valid transcripts of stacks, queues, priority queues, double-ended queues etc. Therefore, any language that can be recognized by these data structures, can also be repaired efficiently by our algorithm."

In certain cases, such a look-ahead can be avoided and the transformation can be realized by a transducer without look-ahead. Removing the look-ahead from a transducer, if possible, is technically highly challenging. For a restricted class of transducers with look-ahead, namely those that are total, deterministic, ultralinear, and bounded erasing, we present an algorithm that, for a given transducer from that class, (1) decides whether it is equivalent to a total deterministic transducer without look-ahead, and (2) constructs such a transducer if the answer is positive. For the whole class of total deterministic transducers with look-ahead we present a similar algorithm, which assumes that a so-called difference bound is known for the given transducer. The designer of a transducer can usually also determine a difference bound for it."

In (Bourreau et al., 2012), the operation of IO-ubstitution was created so as to exhibit mildly context-sensitive classes of languages which are not semilinear, although they verify the constant-growth property. In the present article, we extend the notion of semilinearity, and characterise the Parikh image of the IO-MCFLs (i.e. languages which belong to the closure of MCFLs under IO-subsitution) as universally-linear.

In this paper we continue this line of work.   We give an effective algebraic characterization of the word languages in Sigma2[<,MOD]. The fragment Sigma2 consists of first-order formulas in prenex normal form with two blocks of quantifiers starting with an existential block. In addition we show that Delta2[<,MOD], the largest subclass of Sigma2[<,MOD] which is closed under negation, has the same expressive power as two-variable logic FO2[<,MOD]. This generalizes the result FO2[<] = Delta2[<] of Therien and Wilke to modular predicates. As a byproduct, we obtain another decidable characterization of FO2[<,MOD]."

Quite often in the literature, the automata are allowed to share clocks, i.e. transitions of one automaton may be guarded by conditions on the value of clocks reset by another automaton. This is a problem when one considers implementing such model in a distributed architecture, since reading clocks a priori requires communications which are not explicitly described in the model. We focus on the following question: given an NTA A1 || A2 where A2 reads some clocks reset by A1, does there exist an NTA A'1 || A'2 without shared clocks with the same behavior as the initial NTA? For this, we allow the automata to exchange information during synchronizations only, in particular by copying the value of their neighbor's clocks. We discuss a formalization of the problem and define an appropriate behavioural equivalence. Then we give a criterion using the notion of contextual timed transition system, which represents the behavior of A2 when in parallel with A1. Finally, we effectively build A'1 || A'2 when it exists."

We present an example of a free product of finite semigroups that we conjecture is not an automaton semigroup. Turning to wreath products, we consider two slight generalizations of the concept of an automaton semigroup, and show that a wreath product of an automaton monoid and a finite monoid arises as a generalized automaton semigroup in both senses.

This notion is a refinement of the usual abelian equivalence. A 2-binomial square is a word $uv$ where $u$ and $v$ are 2-binomially equivalent.

In particular, we demonstrate that an arithmetic ASRAM is more powerful than an arithmetic ARAM, that a sufficiently equipped ASRAM can recognise any language in the arithmetic hierarchy in constant time (and more, if it is given more time), and that, on the other hand, in some cases the ASRAM is no more powerful than its underlying RAM."

It is the unique problem between those two whose decidability is uncertain (for already almost two decades). In this paper we show that the context unification is in PSPACE. The result holds under a (usual) assumption that the first-order signature is finite.   This result is obtained by an extension of the recompression technique, recently developed by the author and used in particular to obtain a new PSPACE algorithm for satisfiability of word equations, to context unification. The recompression is based on performing simple compression rules (replacing pairs of neighbouring function symbols), which are (conceptually) applied on the solution of the context equation and modifying the equation in a way so that such compression steps can be in fact performed directly on the equation, without the knowledge of the actual solution."

Usually these algebraic descriptions yield decidability of the question whether a given regular language is definable in a particular fragment. An effective algebraic characterization can be obtained from identities of so-called omega-terms. In order to show that a given fragment satisfies some identity of omega-terms, one can use Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse games on word instances of the omega-terms. The resulting proofs often require a significant amount of book-keeping with respect to the constants involved. In this paper we introduce Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse games on omega-terms. To this end we assign a labeled linear order to every omega-term. Our main theorem shows that a given fragment satisfies some identity of omega-terms if and only if Duplicator has a winning strategy for the game on the resulting linear orders. This allows to avoid the book-keeping. As an application of our main result, we show that one can decide in exponential time whether all aperiodic monoids satisfy some given identity of omega-terms, thereby improving a result of McCammond (Int.

A simulation of such centralized PCPA by one-way multi-head pushdown automata (Balan 2009) turned out to be incomplete (Otto 2012). Subsequently it was shown that centralized returning PCPA are universal even if the number of components is two (Petersen 2013) and thus are separated from one-way multi-head pushdown automata. Another line of research modified the definition of PCPA such that communication is asynchronous (Otto 2013). While the simulation of one-way multi-head pushdown automata is still possible, now a converse construction shows this model in returning mode to be equivalent to the one-way multi-head pushdown automaton in a very precise sense. It was left open, whether non-centralized returning PCPA of degree two are universal. In the first part of the paper we show this to be the case. Then we turn our attention to Uniform Distributed Pushdown Automata Systems (UDPAS). These systems of automata work in turn on a single tape. We show that UPDAS accepting with empty stack do not form a hierarchy depending on the number of components and that the membership problem is complete in NP, answering two open problems from (Arroyo et. al. 2012)."

In this paper, we extend this result to graph directed iterated function systems in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with contraction ratios that are of the form $\frac{1}{\beta}$, for integers $\beta$. By using a result of Boigelot et al., this allows us to give a proof of a conjecture of Adamczewski and Bell. In doing so, we link the graph directed iterated function systems to B\""uchi automata. In particular, this link extends to real numbers $\beta$. We introduce a logical formalism that permits to characterize sets of $\mathbb{R}^n$ whose representations in base $\beta$ are recognized by some B\""uchi automata. This result depends on the algebraic properties of the base: $\beta$ being a Pisot or a Parry number. The main motivation of this work is to draw a general picture representing the different frameworks where an analogue of Cobham's theorem is known."
2013-09-30 07:10:49+00:00,2013-09-30 07:10:49+00:00,"Equality and disjointness are two of the most studied problems in communication complexity. They have been studied for both classical and also quantum communication and for various models and modes of communication. Buhrman et al. [Buh98] proved that the exact quantum communication complexity for a promise version of the equality problem is ${\bf O}(\log {n})$ while the classical deterministic communication complexity is $n+1$ for two-way communication, which was the first impressively large (exponential) gap between quantum and classical (deterministic and probabilistic) communication complexity. If an error is tolerated, both quantum and probabilistic communication complexities for equality are ${\bf O}(\log {n})$. However, even if an error is tolerated, the gaps between quantum (probabilistic) and deterministic complexity are not larger than quadratic for the disjointness problem. It is therefore interesting to ask whether there are some promise versions of the disjointness problem for which bigger gaps can be shown. We give a positive answer to such a question. Namely, we prove that there exists an exponential gap between quantum (even probabilistic) communication complexity and classical deterministic communication complexity of some specific versions of the disjointness problem.   Klauck [Kla00] proved, for any language, that the state complexity of exact quantum/classical finite automata, which is a general model of one-way quantum finite automata, is not less than the state complexity of an equivalent one-way deterministic finite automata (1DFA). In this paper we show, using a communication complexity result, that situation may be different for some promise problems. Namely, we show for certain promise problem that the gap between the state complexity of exact one-way quantum finite automata and 1DFA can be exponential."

Departing from the traditional way of presenting as independent algorithms the deterministic bottom-up LR(1), the top-down LL(1) and the general tabular (Earley) parsers, we unify them in a coherent minimalist framework. We present a simple general construction method for EBNF ELR(1) parsers, where the new category of convergence conflicts is added to the classical shift-reduce and reduce-reduce conflicts; we prove its correctness and show two implementations by deterministic push-down machines and by vector-stack machines, the latter to be also used for Earley parsers. Then the Beatty's theoretical characterization of LL(1) grammars is adapted to derive the extended ELL(1 parsing method, first by minimizing the ELR(1) parser and then by simplifying its state information. Through using the same notations in the ELR(1) case, the extended Earley parser is obtained. Since all the parsers operate on compatible representations, it is feasible to combine them into mixed mode algorithms."

Moreover, the wide variety of such constraints in practical applications led to general modelling techniques and generic propagation algorithms, often based on deterministic finite automata (DFA) and their extensions. We consider counter-DFAs (cDFA), which provide concise models for regular counting constraints, that is constraints over the number of times a regular-language pattern occurs in a sequence. We show how to enforce domain consistency in polynomial time for atmost and atleast regular counting constraints based on the frequent case of a cDFA with only accepting states and a single counter that can be incremented by transitions. We also prove that the satisfaction of exact regular counting constraints is NP-hard and indicate that an incomplete algorithm for exact regular counting constraints is faster and provides more pruning than the existing propagator from [3]. Regular counting constraints are closely related to the CostRegular constraint but contribute both a natural abstraction and some computational advantages."

In this paper we investigate the algorithmic properties of several sub-classes of mean-payoff games where the players have asymmetric information about the state of the game. These games are in general undecidable and not determined according to the classical definition. We show that such games are determined under a more general notion of winning strategy. We also consider mean-payoff games where the winner can be determined by the winner of a finite cycle-forming game. This yields several decidable classes of mean-payoff games of asymmetric information that require only finite-memory strategies, including a generalization of full-observation games where positional strategies are sufficient. We give an exponential time algorithm for determining the winner of the latter."

On the one hand, classical analysis of two-player games involves an adversary (modeling the environment of the system) which is purely antagonistic and asks for strict guarantees. On the other hand, stochastic models like Markov decision processes represent situations where the system is faced to a purely randomized environment: the aim is then to optimize the expected payoff, with no guarantee on individual outcomes. We introduce the beyond worst-case synthesis problem, which is to construct strategies that guarantee some quantitative requirement in the worst-case while providing an higher expected value against a particular stochastic model of the environment given as input. This problem is relevant to produce system controllers that provide nice expected performance in the everyday situation while ensuring a strict (but relaxed) performance threshold even in the event of very bad (while unlikely) circumstances. We study the beyond worst-case synthesis problem for two important quantitative settings: the mean-payoff and the shortest path. In both cases, we show how to decide the existence of finite-memory strategies satisfying the problem and how to synthesize one if one exists. We establish algorithms and we study complexity bounds and memory requirements."

Following the semantics-based approach by Jones, an interpreter is given which, when extended with random-access memory, performs a linear-time simulation of 2DPDA. The recursive interpreter works without the dump list of the original constructions, which makes Cook's insight into linear-time simulation of exponential-time automata more intuitive and the complexity argument clearer. The simulation is then extended to 2-way nondeterministic pushdown automata (2NPDA) to provide for a cubic-time recognition of context-free languages. The time required to run the final construction depends on the degree of nondeterminism. The key mechanism that enables the polynomial-time simulations is the sharing of computations by memoization."

Compositional verification addresses this challenge by decomposing the verification of a large system into the verification of its components. Recent techniques use learning-based approaches to automate compositional verification based on the assume-guarantee style reasoning. However, these techniques are only applicable to finite-state systems. In this work, we propose a new framework that interleaves abstraction and learning to perform automated compositional verification of infinite-state systems. We also discuss the role of learning and abstraction in the related context of interface generation for infinite-state components."

The automaton takes the Tribonacci representation of $n$ as its input; therefore, $(\rho^{\mathrm{ab}}(n))_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is an automatic sequence in a generalized sense. Since our evaluation of $\rho^{\mathrm{ab}}(n)$ uses $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ operations, it is fast even for large values of $n$. Our result also leads to a solution of an open problem proposed by Richomme et al. concerning the characterization of those $n$ for which $\rho^{\mathrm{ab}}(n)=c$ with $c$ belonging to $\{4,5,6,7\}$. In addition, we apply the same approach on the $4$-bonacci word. In this way we find a description of the abelian complexity of the $4$-bonacci word, too."

The gapped repeat is called $\alpha$-gapped if its period is not greater than $\alpha |v|$. A $\delta$-subrepetition is a factor which exponent is less than 2 but is not less than $1+\delta$ (the exponent of the factor is the quotient of the length and the minimal period of the factor). The $\delta$-subrepetition is maximal if it cannot be extended to the left or to the right by at least one letter with preserving its minimal period. We reveal a close relation between maximal gapped repeats and maximal subrepetitions. Moreover, we show that in a word of length $n$ the number of maximal $\alpha$-gapped repeats is bounded by $O(\alpha^2n)$ and the number of maximal $\delta$-subrepetitions is bounded by $O(n/\delta^2)$. Using the obtained upper bounds, we propose algorithms for finding all maximal $\alpha$-gapped repeats and all maximal $\delta$-subrepetitions in a word of length $n$. The algorithm for finding all maximal $\alpha$-gapped repeats has $O(\alpha^2n)$ time complexity for the case of constant alphabet size and $O(n\log n + \alpha^2n)$ time complexity for the general case. For finding all maximal $\delta$-subrepetitions we propose two algorithms. The first algorithm has $O(\frac{n\log\log n}{\delta^2})$ time complexity for the case of constant alphabet size and $O(n\log n +\frac{n\log\log n}{\delta^2})$ time complexity for the general case. The second algorithm has $O(n\log n+\frac{n}{\delta^2}\log \frac{1}{\delta})$ expected time complexity."

A particular case of this result is that the profinite completion of any abstract algebra is the extended Stone dual space of the Boolean algebra of recognizable subsets of the abstract algebra endowed with certain residuation operations. These results identify a connection between topological algebra as applied in algebra and Stone duality as applied in logic, and show that the notion of recognition originating in computer science is intrinsic to profinite completion in mathematics in general. This connection underlies a number of recent results in automata theory including a generalization of Eilenberg-Reiterman theory for regular languages and a new notion of compact recognition applying beyond the setting of regular languages. The purpose of this paper is to give the underlying duality theoretic result in its general form. Further we illustrate the power of the result by providing a few applications in topological algebra and language theory. In particular, we give a simple proof of the fact that any topological algebra quotient of a profinite algebra which is again based on a Boolean space is in fact a profinite algebra and we derive the conditions dual to the ones of the original Eilenberg theorem in a fully modular manner.

While sharing several similarities, the models have fundamental differences, most notably the dynamic nature of CA (in which every cell location is allowed to change state an infinite number of times) versus the static nature of the aTAM (in which tiles are static components that can never change or be removed once they attach to a growing assembly). We work with 2-dimensional systems in both models, and for our results we first define what it means for CA systems to simulate aTAM systems, and then for aTAM systems to simulate CA systems. We use notions of simulate which are similar to those used in the study of intrinsic universality since they are in some sense strict, but also intuitively natural notions of simulation. We then demonstrate a particular nondeterministic CA which can be configured so that it can simulate any arbitrary aTAM system, and finally an aTAM tile set which can be configured so that it can be used to simulate any arbitrary nondeterministic CA system which begins with a finite initial configuration."

If the targets are used for choosing the multiset of rules to be applied, for getting computational completeness with only one catalyst more than one membrane is needed. If the available sets of rules change periodically with time, computational completeness can be obtained with one catalyst in one membrane. Moreover, we also improve existing computational completeness results for P systems with mobile catalysts and for P systems with membrane creation."

Since a finite-state control and a tape cell of a reversible Turing machine (RTM) are formalized as RSMs, any RTM can be constructed from a universal RLEM.

In this paper we present a logic for specifying complex properties of hybrid systems called HyLTL, and we show how it is possible to solve the model checking problem by translating the formula into an equivalent hybrid automaton. In this way the problem is reduced to a reachability problem on hybrid automata that can be solved by using existing tools."

The new object, called World Automaton (WA), is built in such a way to preserve as much as possible of the compositional properties of HIOAs and its underlying theory. From the formal point of view we enrich classical HIOAs with a set of world variables whose values are functions both of time and space. World variables are treated similarly to local variables of HIOAs, except in parallel composition, where the perturbations produced by world variables are summed. In such way, we obtain a structure able to model both agents and environments, thus inducing a hierarchy in the model and leading to the introduction of a new operator. Indeed this operator, called inplacement, is needed to represent the possibility of an object (WA) of living inside another object/environment (WA)."

However, the standard operational semantics defined over such models implicitly assume perfect knowledge of the real systems and infinite precision measurements. Such assumptions are not only unrealistic, but often lead to the construction of misleading models. For these reasons we believe that it is necessary to introduce more flexible semantics able to manage with noise, partial information, and finite precision instruments. In particular, in this paper we integrate in a single framework based on approximated semantics different over and under-approximation techniques for hybrid automata. Our framework allows to both compare, mix, and generalize such techniques obtaining different approximated reachability algorithms."

We use the tuple (\sigma,\rho,\pi) to denote various acceptance modes, where \sigma denotes that some designated elements should appear at least once or infinitely often, \rho denotes some binary relation between two sets, and \pi denotes normal or leftmost derivations. Technically, we propose (\sigma,\rho,\pi)-accepting \omega-grammars, and systematically study their relative generative power with respect to (\sigma,\rho)-accepting \omega-automata. We show how to construct some special forms of \omega-grammars, such as \epsilon-production-free \omega-grammars. We study the equivalence or inclusion relations between \omega$-grammars and \omega-automata by establishing the translation techniques. In particular, we show that, for some acceptance modes, the generative power of \omega-CFG is strictly weaker than \omega-PDA, and the generative power of \omega-CSG is equal to \omega-TM (rather than linear-bounded \omega-automata-like devices). Furthermore, we raise some remaining open problems for two of the acceptance modes."

Developing a formal specification is a challenging and tedious task and initial specifications are often unrealizable. In many cases, the source of unrealizability is the lack of adequate assumptions on the environment of the system. In this paper, we consider the problem of automatically correcting an unrealizable specification given in the generalized reactivity (1) fragment of linear temporal logic by adding assumptions on the environment. When a temporal-logic specification is unrealizable, the synthesis algorithm computes a counter-strategy as a witness. Our algorithm then analyzes this counter-strategy and synthesizes a set of candidate environment assumptions that can be used to remove the counter-strategy from the environment's possible behaviors. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach with several case studies."

We also present a game characterization for these timed relations and show that the game hierarchy reflects the hierarchy of the timed relations. One can obtain an infinite game hierarchy and thus the game characterization further indicates the possibility of defining new timed relations which have not been studied yet. The game characterization also helps us to come up with a formula which encodes the separation between two states that are not timed bisimilar. Such distinguishing formulae can also be generated for many relations other than timed bisimilarity."

The aim of this paper is a transfer to the domain of comtraces and developing of some fundamental notions, which proved to be successful in the theory of traces. In particular, we introduce and then apply the notion of indivisible steps, the lexicographical canonical form of comtraces, as well as the representation of a comtrace utilising its linear projections to binary action subalphabets. We also provide two algorithms related to the new notions. Using them, one can solve, in an efficient way, the problem of step sequence equivalence in the context of comtraces.

Also the halting problem has three variants: does a given program halt on the empty input, does a given program halt when given itself as its input, or does a given program halt on a given input. The failure rate of a tester for some size is the proportion of hard instances among all instances of that size. This publication investigates the behaviour of the failure rate as the size grows without limit. Earlier results are surveyed and new results are proven. Some of them use C++ on Linux as the computational model. It turns out that the behaviour is sensitive to the details of the programming language or computational model, but in many cases it is possible to prove that the proportion of hard instances does not vanish."

They use a syntactic fragment RMSOL of WMSOL to characterize word functions (power series) recognizable by weighted automata, where the semantics of quantifiers is used both as arithmetical operations and, in the boolean case, as quantification.   Already in 2001, B. Courcelle, J.Makowsky and U. Rotics have introduced a formalism for graph parameters definable in Monadic Second order Logic, here called MSOLEVAL with values in a ring R. Their framework can be easily adapted to semirings S. This formalism clearly separates the logical part from the arithmetical part and also applies to word functions.   In this paper we give two proofs that RMSOL and MSOLEVAL with values in S have the same expressive power over words. One proof shows directly that MSOLEVAL captures the functions recognizable by weighted automata. The other proof shows how to translate the formalisms from one into the other."

Since the 1960s, there has been a steady progress of constructions: by McNaughton, Safra, Piterman, Schewe, and others. Despite the proliferation of solutions, they are all essentially ad-hoc constructions, with little theory behind them other than proofs of correctness. Since Safra, all optimal constructions employ trees as states of the deterministic automaton, and transitions between states are defined operationally over these trees. The operational nature of these constructions complicates understanding, implementing, and reasoning about them, and should be contrasted with complementation, where a solid theory in terms of automata run DAGs underlies modern constructions.   In 2010, we described a profile-based approach to Buchi complementation, where a profile is simply the history of visits to accepting states. We developed a structural theory of profiles and used it to describe a complementation construction that is deterministic in the limit. Here we extend the theory of profiles to prove that every run DAG contains a profile tree with at most a finite number of infinite branches. We then show that this property provides a theoretical grounding for a new determinization construction where macrostates are doubly preordered sets of states. In contrast to extant determinization constructions, transitions in the new construction are described declaratively rather than operationally."

The paper is generalized to non-prefix-closed languages, that is, supremal conditionally controllable sublanguages of not necessary prefix-closed languages are discussed. Non-prefix-closed languages introduce the blocking issue into coordination control, hence a procedure to compute a coordinator for nonblockingness is included. The optimization problem concerning the size of a coordinator is under investigation. We prove that to find the minimal extension of the coordinator event set for which a given specification language is conditionally decomposable is NP-hard. In other words, unless P=NP, it is not possible to find a polynomial algorithm to compute the minimal coordinator with respect to the number of events."

This general model strictly subsumes both priced timed automata and unbounded priced Petri nets. We study the cost of computations that reach a given control-state. In general, a computation with minimal cost may not exist, due to strict inequalities in the time constraints. However, we show that the infimum of the costs to reach a given control-state is computable in the case where all place and transition costs are non-negative.

In this paper we explore the expressiveness of stateful connectors obtained by adding one-place buffers or unbounded buffers to the stateless connectors. The main results are: i) we show how different classes of connectors exactly correspond to suitable classes of Petri nets equipped with compositional interfaces, called nets with boundaries; ii) we show that the difference between strong and weak semantics in stateful connectors is reflected in the semantics of nets with boundaries by moving from the classic step semantics (strong case) to a novel banking semantics (weak case), where a step can be executed by taking some 'debit' tokens to be given back during the same step; iii) we show that the corresponding bisimilarities are congruences (w.r.t. composition of connectors in series and in parallel); iv) we show that suitable monoidality laws, like those arising when representing stateful connectors in the tile model, can nicely capture concurrency (in the sense of step semantics) aspects; and v) as a side result, we provide a basic algebra, with a finite set of symbols, out of which we can compose all P/T nets with boundaries, fulfilling a long standing quest."

The paper also determines which type of linear time notions permit full learnability for learning in the limit of automatic classes (families of languages which are uniformly recognised by a finite automaton). In particular it is shown that a function is automatic iff there is a one-tape Turing machine with a left end which computes the function in linear time where the input before the computation and the output after the computation both start at the left end. It is known that learners realised as automatic update functions are restrictive for learning. In the present work it is shown that one can overcome the problem by providing work tapes additional to a resource-bounded base tape while keeping the update-time to be linear in the length of the largest datum seen so far. In this model, one additional such work tape provides additional learning power over the automatic learner model and two additional work tapes give full learning power. Furthermore, one can also consider additional queues or additional stacks in place of additional work tapes and for these devices, one queue or two stacks are sufficient for full learning power while one stack is insufficient."

One of the most popular constructions, due to Glushkov and to McNaughton and Yamada, is based on the computation of the Null, First, Last and Follow sets (called Glushkov functions) associated with a linearized version of the expression. Recently Mignot considered a family of extended expressions called Extended to multi-tilde-bar Regular Expressions (EmtbREs) and he showed that, under some restrictions, Glushkov functions can be defined for an EmtbRE. In this paper we present an algorithm which efficiently computes the Glushkov functions of an unrestricted EmtbRE. Our approach is based on a recursive definition of the language associated with an EmtbRE which enlightens the fact that the worst case time complexity of the conversion of an EmtbRE into an automaton is related to the worst case time complexity of the computation of the Null function. Finally we show how to extend the ZPC-structure to EmtbREs, which allows us to apply to this family of extended expressions the efficient constructions based on this structure (in particular the construction of the c-continuation automaton, the position automaton, the follow automaton and the equation automaton)."

Specifically, we ask for which monoids valence automata can accept only context-free languages or only languages with semilinear Parikh image, respectively.   First, we present a characterization of those graph products (of monoids) for which valence automata accept only context-free languages. Second, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for a graph product of copies of the bicyclic monoid and the integers to yield only languages with semilinear Parikh image when used as a storage mechanism in valence automata.

Thus, it fixes the shortcomings of related work, without restricting designers to deterministic interfaces as Raclet et al.'s modal interface theory does."

We show that control-state reachability for level $k$ \HOCS with $0$-test is complete for \mbox{$(k-2)$}-fold exponential space; leaving out the $0$-test leads to completeness for \mbox{$(k-2)$}-fold exponential time. Restricting \HOCS (without $0$-test) to level $2$, we prove that global (forward or backward) reachability analysis is $\PTIME$-complete. This enhances the known result for pushdown systems which are subsumed by level $2$ \HOCS without $0$-test.   We transfer our results to the formal language setting. Assuming that $\PTIME \subsetneq \PSPACE \subsetneq \mathbf{EXPTIME}$, we apply proof ideas of Engelfriet and conclude that the hierarchies of languages of \HOPS and of \HOCS form strictly interleaving hierarchies.

However, this question is only open for Turing Machines, not for Random Access Machines (RAMs).   Simon (1981) was able to show that for a sufficiently equipped Random Access Machine, the ability to switch states nondeterministically does not entail any computational advantage. However, in the same paper, Simon describes a different (and arguably more natural) scenario for stochasticity under the RAM model. According to Simon's proposal, instead of receiving a new random bit at each execution step, the RAM program is able to execute the pseudofunction $\textit{RAND}(y)$, which returns a uniformly distributed random integer in the range $[0,y)$. Whether the ability to allot a random integer in this fashion is more powerful than the ability to allot a random bit remained an open question for the last 30 years.   In this paper, we close Simon's open problem, by fully characterising the class of languages recognisable in polynomial time by each of the RAMs regarding which the question was posed. We show that for some of these, stochasticity entails no advantage, but, more interestingly, we show that for others it does."

The main result is that a sequential transducer which computes for all n the minimal word associated with n+1 from the one associated with n, has essentially the same underlying graph as the tree itself.

In essence, an FQL test specification amounts to a set of regular languages, each of which has to be matched by at least one test execution. To describe such sets of regular languages, the FQL semantics uses an automata-theoretic concept known as rational sets of regular languages (RSRLs). RSRLs are automata whose alphabet consists of regular expressions. Thus, the language accepted by the automaton is a set of regular expressions.   In this paper, we study RSRLs from a theoretic point of view. More specifically, we analyze RSRL closure properties under common set theoretic operations, and the complexity of membership checking, i.e., whether a regular language is an element of a RSRL. For all questions we investigate both the general case and the case of finite sets of regular languages. Although a few properties are left as open problems, the paper provides a systematic semantic foundation for the test specification language FQL."

Formally, the decision version of the minimization problem of fuzzy automata is as follows: \begin{itemize}   \item Given a fuzzy automaton $\mathcal{A}$ and a natural number $k$, that is, a pair $\langle \mathcal{A}, k\rangle$, is there a $k$-state fuzzy automaton equivalent to $\mathcal{A}$? \end{itemize} We prove for the first time that the above problem is decidable for fuzzy automata over totally ordered lattices. To this end, we first give the concept of systems of fuzzy polynomial equations and then present a procedure to solve these systems. Afterwards, we apply the solvability of a system of fuzzy polynomial equations to the minimization problem mentioned above, obtaining the decidability. Finally, we point out that the above problem is at least as hard as PSAPCE-complete."

We also show that several problems which are deceptively simple in the usual definitions, become undecidable when we allow for local probabilistic correlations, even in dimension one. Armed with this formalism, we extend the notion of intrinsic simulation between deterministic cellular automata, to the non-deterministic and stochas- tic settings. Although the intrinsic simulation relation is shown to become undecidable in dimension two and higher, we provide explicit tools to prove or disprove the existence of such a simulation between any two given stochastic cellular automata. Those tools rely upon a characterization of equality of stochastic global maps, shown to be equivalent to the existence of a stochastic coupling between the random sources.

In this paper, we solve two decision problems for this model. First, we define the register complexity of an additive regular function to be the minimum number of registers that an ACRA needs to compute it. We characterize the register complexity by a necessary and sufficient condition regarding the largest subset of registers whose values can be made far apart from one another. We then use this condition to design a PSPACE algorithm to compute the register complexity of a given ACRA, and establish a matching lower bound. Our results also lead to a machine-independent characterization of the register complexity of additive regular functions. Second, we consider two-player games over ACRAs, where the objective of one of the players is to reach a target set while minimizing the cost.

The primary motivation comes from the study of logics for querying graph topology, which have recently found numerous applications. Such logics use conditions on paths expressed by regular languages and relations, but they often need to be extended by rational relations such as subword or subsequence. Evaluating formulae in such extended graph logics boils down to checking nonemptiness of the intersection of rational relations with regular or recognizable relations (or, more generally, to the generalized intersection problem, asking whether some projections of a regular relation have a nonempty intersection with a given rational relation).   We prove that for several basic and commonly used rational relations, the intersection problem with regular relations is either undecidable (e.g., for subword or suffix, and some generalizations), or decidable with non-primitive-recursive complexity (e.g., for subsequence and its generalizations). These results are used to rule out many classes of graph logics that freely combine regular and rational relations, as well as to provide the simplest problem related to verifying lossy channel systems that has non-primitive-recursive complexity. We then prove a dichotomy result for logics combining regular conditions on individual paths and rational relations on paths, by showing that the syntactic form of formulae classifies them into either efficiently checkable or undecidable cases. We also give examples of rational relations for which such logics are decidable even without syntactic restrictions."

For the first problem, we give upper and lower bounds of the form alpha^(2^n) in the binary case. For the second problem, we give a weak upper bound and some experimental data.

More precisely, we show that the action of the Karoubi envelope on the Krieger cover of the shift is a flow invariant. An analogous result concerning the Fischer cover of a synchronizing shift is also obtained. From these main results, several flow equivalence invariants --- some new and some old --- are obtained. We also show that the Karoubi envelope is, in a natural sense, the best possible syntactic invariant of flow equivalence of sofic shifts. Another application concerns the classification of Markov-Dyck and Markov-Motzkin shifts: it is shown that, under mild conditions, two graphs define flow equivalent shifts if and only if they are isomorphic. Shifts with property (A) and their associated semigroups, introduced by Wolfgang Krieger, are interpreted in terms of the Karoubi envelope, yielding a proof of the flow invariance of the associated semigroups in the cases usually considered (a result recently announced by Krieger), and also a proof that property (A) is decidable for sofic shifts."

Using the equivalence between the two LTSs, we identify a class of communicating automata that exactly correspond to the projected local types.

The problem is coNP-complete when all processes are finite-state machines, and is PSPACE-complete when they are pushdown machines. The complexity remains coNP-complete when each Turing machine is allowed boundedly many interactions with the register.

In this paper we prove the following limitations on the class of L-automatic structures for a fixed L of finite condensation rank 1+\alpha. Firstly, no scattered linear order with finite condensation rank above \omega^(\alpha+1) is L-\alpha-automatic. In particular, every L-automatic ordinal is below \omega^\omega^(\alpha+1). Secondly, we provide bounds on the (ordinal) height of well-founded order trees that are L-automatic. If \alpha is finite or L is an ordinal, the height of such a tree is bounded by \omega^{\alpha+1}.

In this paper we consider two such restricted specification logics, linear temporal logic (LTL) and two-variable first-order logic (FO2). LTL is more expressive but FO2 can be more succinct, and hence it is not clear which should be easier to verify. We take a comprehensive look at the issue, giving a comparison of verification problems for FO2, LTL, and various sublogics thereof across a wide range of models. In particular, we look at unary temporal logic (UTL), a subset of LTL that is expressively equivalent to FO2; we also consider the stutter-free fragment of FO2, obtained by omitting the successor relation, and the expressively equivalent fragment of UTL, obtained by omitting the next and previous connectives. We give three logic-to-automata translations which can be used to give upper bounds for FO2 and UTL and various sublogics. We apply these to get new bounds for both non-deterministic systems (hierarchical and recursive state machines, games) and for probabilistic systems (Markov chains, recursive Markov chains, and Markov decision processes). We couple these with matching lower-bound arguments. Next, we look at combining FO2 verification techniques with those for LTL. We present here a language that subsumes both FO2 and LTL, and inherits the model checking properties of both languages. Our results give both a unified approach to understanding the behaviour of FO2 and LTL, along with a nearly comprehensive picture of the complexity of verification for these logics and their sublogics."

The proof of this result revolves around specific ideas on what we consider a ""proper"" monitor. As these ideas are general, we outline them first in the setting of standard LTL, before lifting them to the setting of first-order logic and LTLFO. Although due to the above result one cannot hope to obtain a complete monitor for LTLFO, we prove the soundness of our automata-based construction and give experimental results from an implementation. These seem to substantiate our hypothesis that the automata-based construction leads to efficient runtime monitors whose size does not grow with increasing trace lengths (as is often observed in similar approaches).

Two more powerful reducibilities--bounded truth-table and Turing CFL-reducibilities--are also discussed in comparison. The Turing CFL-reducibility, in particular, helps us introduce an exquisite hierarchy, called the CFL hierarchy, built over the family CFL of context-free languages. For each level of this hierarchy, its basic structural properties are proven and three alternative characterizations are presented. The second level is not included in NC(2) unless NP= NC(2). The first and second levels of the hierarchy are different. The rest of the hierarchy (more strongly, the Boolean hierarchy built over each level of the hierarchy) is also infinite unless the polynomial hierarchy over NP collapses. This follows from a characterization of the Boolean hierarchy over the k-th level of the polynomial hierarchy in terms of the Boolean hierarchy over the k+1st level of the CFL hierarchy using log-space many-one reductions. Similarly, the complexity class Theta(k) is related to the closure of the k-th level of the CFL hierarchy under log-space truth-table reductions. We also argue that the CFL hierarchy coincides with a hierarchy over CFL built by application of many-one CFL-reductions. We show that BPCFL--a bounded-error probabilistic version of CFL--is not included in CFL even in the presence of advice. Employing a known circuit lower bound and a switching lemma, we exhibit a relativized world where BPCFL is not located within the second level of the CFL hierarchy."

We prove decidability of the emptiness problem for TABG. This solves, in particular, the open question of the decidability of emptiness for TAGED.

2013-02-16 22:09:17+00:00,2014-04-15 12:53:49+00:00,"Computational approaches to exploring ""chemical universes"", i.e., very large sets, potentially infinite sets of compounds that can be constructed by a prescribed collection of reaction mechanisms, in practice suffer from a combinatorial explosion. It quickly becomes impossible to test, for all pairs of compounds in a rapidly growing network, whether they can react with each other. More sophisticated and efficient strategies are therefore required to construct very large chemical reaction networks.   Undirected labeled graphs and graph rewriting are natural models of chemical compounds and chemical reactions. Borrowing the idea of partial evaluation from functional programming, we introduce partial applications of rewrite rules. Binding substrate to rules increases the number of rules but drastically prunes the substrate sets to which it might match, resulting in dramatically reduced resource requirements. At the same time, exploration strategies can be guided, e.g. based on restrictions on the product molecules to avoid the explicit enumeration of very unlikely compounds. To this end we introduce here a generic framework for the specification of exploration strategies in graph-rewriting systems. Using key examples of complex chemical networks from sugar chemistry and the realm of metabolic networks we demonstrate the feasibility of a high-level strategy framework.   The ideas presented here can not only be used for a strategy-based chemical space exploration that has close correspondence of experimental results, but are much more general. In particular, the framework can be used to emulate higher-level transformation models such as illustrated in a small puzzle game."
2013-02-15 22:24:44+00:00,2013-05-22 21:33:57+00:00,"We relate two measures of complexity of regular languages. The first is syntactic complexity, that is, the cardinality of the syntactic semigroup of the language. That semigroup is isomorphic to the semigroup of transformations of states induced by non-empty words in the minimal deterministic finite automaton accepting the language. If the language has n left quotients (its minimal automaton has n states), then its syntactic complexity is at most n^n and this bound is tight. The second measure consists of the quotient (state) complexities of the atoms of the language, where atoms are non-empty intersections of complemented and uncomplemented quotients. A regular language has at most 2^n atoms and this bound is tight. The maximal quotient complexity of any atom with r complemented quotients is 2^n-1, if r=0 or r=n, and 1+\sum_{k=1}^{r} \sum_{h=k+1}^{k+n-r} \binom{h}{n} \binom{k}{h}, otherwise. We prove that if a language has maximal syntactic complexity, then it has 2^n atoms and each atom has maximal quotient complexity, but the converse is false."

Specifically, we ask which storage mechanisms admit a transformation of a given automaton into one that accepts the same language and reads at least one input symbol in each step.   We study this question using the model of valence automata. Here, a finite automaton is equipped with a storage mechanism that is given by a monoid.   This work presents generalizations of known results on silent transitions. For two classes of monoids, it provides characterizations of those monoids that allow the removal of \lambda-transitions. Both classes are defined by graph products of copies of the bicyclic monoid and the group of integers. The first class contains pushdown storages as well as the blind counters while the second class contains the blind and the partially blind counters."

Conversely, we prove that for any restricted SA-hypergraph automaton, there exists a Wang Tile System, a model for recognizable picture languages, that accepts the same language. The advantage of SA-hypergraph automata over Wang automata, acceptors for the class of recognizable picture languages, is that they do not rely on an a priori defined scanning strategy"

We use polynomial identity testing and the Isolation Lemma to obtain complexity bounds, focussing on the class NC of problems within P solvable in polylogarithmic parallel time. For finite Q-weighted automata, we give a randomised NC procedure that either outputs that two automata are equivalent or returns a word on which they differ. We also give an NC procedure for deciding whether a given automaton is minimal, as well as a randomised NC procedure that minimises an automaton. We consider probabilistic automata with rewards, similar to Markov Decision Processes. For these automata we consider two notions of equivalence: expectation equivalence and distribution equivalence. The former requires that two automata have the same expected reward on each input word, while the latter requires that each input word induce the same distribution on rewards in each automaton. For both notions we give algorithms for deciding equivalence by reduction to equivalence of Q-weighted automata. Finally we show that the equivalence problem for Q-weighted visibly pushdown automata is logspace equivalent to the polynomial identity testing problem."

First we define the dual set, of initial configurations from which a non-terminating execution exists, as the greatest fixpoint of the function that maps a set of states into its pre-image with respect to the transition relation. This definition allows to compute the weakest non-termination precondition if at least one of the following holds: (i) the transition relation is deterministic, (ii) the descending Kleene sequence overapproximating the greatest fixpoint converges in finitely many steps, or (iii) the transition relation is well founded. We show that this is the case for two classes of relations, namely octagonal and finite monoid affine relations. Moreover, since the closed forms of these relations can be defined in Presburger arithmetic, we obtain the decidability of the termination problem for such loops."

We consider two recent approaches to complementation. The first is the rank-based approach of Kupferman and Vardi, which operates over a DAG that embodies all runs of the automaton. This approach is based on the observation that the vertices of this DAG can be ranked in a certain way, termed an odd ranking, iff all runs are rejecting. The second is the slice-based approach of K\""ahler and Wilke. This approach tracks levels of ""split trees"" - run trees in which only essential information about the history of each run is maintained. While the slice-based construction is conceptually simple, the complementing automata it generates are exponentially larger than those of the recent rank-based construction of Schewe, and it suffers from the difficulty of symbolically encoding levels of split trees. In this work we reformulate the slice-based approach in terms of run DAGs and preorders over states. In doing so, we begin to draw parallels between the rank-based and slice-based approaches. Through deeper analysis of the slice-based approach, we strongly restrict the nondeterminism it generates. We are then able to employ the slice-based approach to provide a new odd ranking, called a retrospective ranking, that is different from the one provided by Kupferman and Vardi. This new ranking allows us to construct a deterministic-in-the-limit rank-based automaton with a highly restricted transition function. Further, by phrasing the slice-based approach in terms of ranks, our approach affords a simple symbolic encoding and achieves the tight bound of Schewe's construction"

2013-01-30 23:02:36+00:00,2013-01-30 23:02:36+00:00,Formal verification of complex algorithms is challenging. Verifying their implementations goes beyond the state of the art of current automatic verification tools and usually involves intricate mathematical theorems. Certifying algorithms compute in addition to each output a witness certifying that the output is correct. A checker for such a witness is usually much simpler than the original algorithm - yet it is all the user has to trust. The verification of checkers is feasible with current tools and leads to computations that can be completely trusted. We describe a framework to seamlessly verify certifying computations. We use the automatic verifier VCC for establishing the correctness of the checker and the interactive theorem prover Isabelle/HOL for high-level mathematical properties of algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by presenting the verification of typical examples of the industrial-level and widespread algorithmic library LEDA.

In our formulation, canalization becomes synonymous with redundancy present in the logic of automata. This results in straightforward measures to quantify canalization in an automaton (micro-level), which is in turn integrated into a highly scalable framework to characterize the collective dynamics of large-scale automata networks (macro-level). This way, our approach provides a method to link micro- to macro-level dynamics -- a crux of complexity. Several new results ensue from this methodology: uncovering of dynamical modularity (modules in the dynamics rather than in the structure of networks), identification of minimal conditions and critical nodes to control the convergence to attractors, simulation of dynamical behaviour from incomplete information about initial conditions, and measures of macro-level canalization and robustness to perturbations. We exemplify our methodology with a well-known model of the intra- and inter cellular genetic regulation of body segmentation in Drosophila melanogaster. We use this model to show that our analysis does not contradict any previous findings. But we also obtain new knowledge about its behaviour: a better understanding of the size of its wild-type attractor basin (larger than previously thought), the identification of novel minimal conditions and critical nodes that control wild-type behaviour, and the resilience of these to stochastic interventions. Our methodology is applicable to any complex network that can be modelled using automata, but we focus on biochemical regulation and signalling, towards a better understanding of the (decentralized) control that orchestrates cellular activity -- with the ultimate goal of explaining how do cells and tissues 'compute'."

In particular deterministic two-way transducers capture exactly the class of MSO-transductions of finite strings. In this paper, we address the following definability problem: given a function defined by a two-way finite state transducer, is it definable by a one-way finite state transducer?

This question has been investigated using tools from combinatorics, dynamic programming, and graph theory, and has practical applications in Bayesian phylogenetics. In this work, we revisit this theoretical question from a different point of view, based on linear algebra. The main contribution is a new proof of a known result on the complexity of inference on TKF91, a well-known probabilistic model over strings. Our proof uses a different approach based on classical linear algebra results, and is in some cases easier to extend to other models.

After we introduce and justify the the notion of the genus for regular languages, the following questions are addressed. First, depending on the size of the alphabet, we provide upper and lower bounds on the genus of regular languages : we show that under a relatively generic condition on the alphabet and the geometry of the automata, the genus grows at least linearly in terms of the size of the automata. Second, we show that the topological cost of the powerset determinization procedure is exponential. Third, we prove that the notion of minimization is orthogonal to the notion of genus. Fourth, we build regular languages of arbitrary large genus: the notion of genus defines a proper hierarchy of regular languages."

Recent literature, mainly under the motivation of widening the application of model checking techniques, extended the analysis of these languages from the simple regular ones to various classes of languages with 'visible syntax structure', such as visibly pushdown languages (VPLs). Operator precedence languages (OPLs), instead, were originally defined to support deterministic parsing and, though seemingly unrelated, exhibit interesting relations with these classes of languages: OPLs strictly include VPLs, enjoy all relevant closure properties and have been characterized by a suitable automata family and a logic notation. In this paper we introduce operator precedence \omega-languages (\omega OPLs), investigating various acceptance criteria and their closure properties. Whereas some properties are natural extensions of those holding for regular languages, others required novel investigation techniques. Application-oriented examples show the gain in expressiveness and verifiability offered by \omega OPLs w.r.t. smaller classes."

In this paper, we propose a base algorithm which minimizes, since the first stages of its design, the incidence of the size of the alphabet in both time and space complexities. This base algorithm, inspired by the one of Paige and Tarjan in 1987 for bisimulation and the one of Ranzato and Tapparo in 2010 for simulation, is then derived in three versions. One of them has the best bit space complexity up to now, $O(|P_{sim}|^2+|{\rightarrow}|.\log|{\rightarrow}|)$, while another one has the best time complexity up to now, $O(|P_{sim}|.|{\rightarrow}|)$. Note the absence of the alphabet in these complexities. A third version happens to be a nice compromise between space and time since it runs in $O(b.|P_{sim}|.|{\rightarrow}|)$ time, with $b$ a branching factor generally far below $|P_{sim}|$, and uses $O(|P_{sim}|^2.\log|P_{sim}|+|{\rightarrow}|.\log|{\rightarrow}|)$ bits."

The expressive power of compositions of such transducers with and without regular look-ahead is investigated. In particular, the restrictions of nondeletion, epsilon-freeness, and strictness are considered. The composition hierarchy turns out to be finite for all epsilon-free (all rules consume input) variants of these transducers except for nondeleting epsilon-free linear extended top-down tree transducers. The least number of transducers needed for the full expressive power of arbitrary compositions is presented. In all remaining cases (including nondeleting epsilon-free linear extended top-down tree transducers) the composition hierarchy does not collapse."
2012-12-31 18:13:55+00:00,2013-08-09 16:30:51+00:00,"The theory of regular cost functions is a quantitative extension to the classical notion of regularity. A cost function associates to each input a non-negative integer value (or infinity), as opposed to languages which only associate to each input the two values ""inside"" and ""outside"". This theory is a continuation of the works on distance automata and similar models. These models of automata have been successfully used for solving the star-height problem, the finite power property, the finite substitution problem, the relative inclusion star-height problem and the boundedness problem for monadic-second order logic over words. Our notion of regularity can be -- as in the classical theory of regular languages -- equivalently defined in terms of automata, expressions, algebraic recognisability, and by a variant of the monadic second-order logic. These equivalences are strict extensions of the corresponding classical results. The present paper introduces the cost monadic logic, the quantitative extension to the notion of monadic second-order logic we use, and show that some problems of existence of bounds are decidable for this logic. This is achieved by introducing the corresponding algebraic formalism: stabilisation monoids."

This shows that it is decidable for a given regular language and a non-negative integer m, whether the language is definable by a formula in FO^2[<,suc] which has at most m quantifier alternations. We also consider the alternation hierarchy of unary temporal logic TL[X,F,Y,P] defined by the maximal number of nested negations. This hierarchy coincides with the FO^2[<,suc] alternation hierarchy."

This paper presents the buffered $\pi$-calculus --- a variant of the $\pi$-calculus where channel names are classified into buffered and unbuffered: communication along buffered channels is asynchronous, and remains synchronous along unbuffered channels. We show that the buffered $\pi$-calculus can be fully simulated in the polyadic $\pi$-calculus with respect to strong bisimulation. In contrast to the $\pi$-calculus which is hard to use in practice, the new language enables easy and clear modeling of practical concurrent languages. We encode two real-world concurrent languages in the buffered $\pi$-calculus: the (core) Go language and the (Core) Erlang. Both encodings are fully abstract with respect to weak bisimulations."

In particular, we give their characterization in terms of unrestricted Rabin automata. We show that if $X \subset A^{\Sigma^*}$ is a sofic tree shift, then the configurations in $X$ whose orbit under the shift action is finite are dense in $X$, and, as a consequence of this, we deduce that every injective cellular automata $\tau\colon X \to X$ is surjective. Moreover, a characterization of sofic tree shifts in terms of general Rabin automata is given.   We present an algorithm for establishing whether two unrestricted Rabin automata accept the same sofic tree shift or not. This allows us to prove the decidability of the surjectivity problem for cellular automata between sofic tree shifts. We also prove the decidability of the injectivity problem for cellular automata defined on a tree shift of finite type."

Moreover, it is shown how to construct an alternating automaton associated with the derivation of a regular expression in this general framework. Finally, Brzozowski's derivation and Antimirov's derivation turn out to be a particular case of this general scheme and it is shown how to construct a DFA, a NFA and an AFA for both of these derivations."

2012-12-17 03:42:40+00:00,2012-12-17 03:42:40+00:00,"Automata representing game-semantic models of programs are meant to operate in environments whose input-output behaviour is constrained by the rules of a game. This can lead to a notion of equivalence between states which is weaker than the conventional notion of bisimulation, since not all actions are available to the environment. An environment which attempts to break the rules of the game is, effectively, mounting a low-level attack against a system. In this paper we show how (and why) to enforce game rules in games-based hardware synthesis and how to use this weaker notion of equivalence, called coherent equivalence, to aggressively minimise automata."

Next to providing the required functionality the composite services must also provide a reasonable level of security in order to protect sensitive data. Thus, the orchestrator has a need to check whether the complex service is able to satisfy certain properties. Some properties are expressed with metrics for precise definition of requirements. Thus, the problem is to analyse the values of metrics for a complex business process.   In this paper we extend our previous work on analysis of secure orchestration with quantifiable properties. We show how to define, verify and enforce quantitative security requirements in one framework with other security properties. The proposed approach should help to select the most suitable service architecture and guarantee fulfilment of the declared security requirements."

The workshop was affiliated with the 18th Symposium on Formal Methods, FM 2012. The focus of the workshop was on quantities in modeling, verification, and synthesis. Modern applications of formal methods require to reason formally on quantities such as time, resources, or probabilities. Standard formal methods and tools have gotten very good at modeling (and verifying) qualitative properties: whether or not certain events will occur. During the last years, these methods and tools have been extended to also cover quantitative aspects, notably leading to tools like e.g. UPPAAL (for real-time systems), PRISM (for probabilistic systems), and PHAVer (for hybrid systems). A lot of work remains to be done however before these tools can be used in the industrial applications at which they are aiming."

Multi-pushdown systems model recursive concurrent programs in which any sequential process has a finite control. We consider three standard notions for boundedness: context boundedness, phase boundedness and stack ordering. The logical formalism is a linear-time temporal logic extending well-known logic CaRet but dedicated to multi-pushdown systems in which abstract operators (related to calls and returns) such as those for next-time and until are parameterized by stacks. We show that the problem is EXPTIME-complete for context-bounded runs and unary encoding of the number of context switches; we also prove that the problem is 2EXPTIME-complete for phase-bounded runs and unary encoding of the number of phase switches. In both cases, the value k is given as an input (whence it is not a constant of the model-checking problem), which makes a substantial difference in the complexity. In certain cases, our results improve previous complexity results."

We prove that for each one-way nondeterministic automaton with $n$ states there exist Parikh equivalent one-way and two-way deterministic automata with $e^{O(\sqrt{n \ln n})}$ and $p(n)$ states, respectively, where $p(n)$ is a polynomial. Furthermore, these costs are tight. In contrast, if all the words accepted by the given automaton contain at least two different letters, then a Parikh equivalent one-way deterministic automaton with a polynomial number of states can be found.   Concerning context-free grammars, we prove that for each grammar in Chomsky normal form with h variables there exist Parikh equivalent one-way and two-way deterministic automata with $2^{O(h^2)}$ and $2^{O(h)}$ states, respectively. Even these bounds are tight."

We propose a notion of graph associated to a language, which conserves or generalizes these features. Whereas Cayley graphs are very regular; associated graphs are arbitrary, although of a bounded degree. Moreover, it is well-known that cellular automata can be characterized as the set of translation-invariant continuous functions for a distance on the set of configurations that makes it a compact metric space; this point of view makes it easy to extend their definition from grids to Cayley graphs. Similarly, we extend their definition to these arbitrary, bounded degree, time-varying graphs. The obtained notion of Cellular Automata over generalized Cayley graphs is stable under composition and under inversion.

We examine the statistical properties of its cooperative behavior, and perform model selection to determine whether this aspect of the system can be described by a finite-state process, or whether reference to an effectively unbounded resource allows for a more parsimonious description. We find strong evidence, in a majority of the most-edited pages, in favor of a collective-state model, where the probability of a ""revert"" action declines as the square root of the number of non-revert actions seen since the last revert. We provide evidence that the emergence of this social counter is driven by collective interaction effects, rather than properties of individual users."

Safety property, invariant property, liveness property, persistence and dual-persistence properties in multi-valued logic systems are introduced. Some algorithms related to the above multi-valued linear-time properties are discussed. The verification of multi-valued regular safety properties and multi-valued $\omega$-regular properties using lattice-valued automata are thoroughly studied. Since the law of non-contradiction (i.e., $a\wedge \neg a=0$) and the law of excluded-middle (i.e., $a\vee \neg a=1$) do not hold in multi-valued logic, the linear-time properties introduced in this paper have the new forms compared to those in classical logic. Compared to those classical model checking methods, our methods to multi-valued model checking are more directly accordingly. A new form of multi-valued model checking with membership degree is also introduced. In particular, we show that multi-valued model-checking can be reduced to the classical model checking. The related verification algorithms are also presented. Some illustrative examples and case study are also provided."

Nevertheless, K_m proves to be a finer-grained measure and a potential alternative approach to lossless compression algorithms for small entities, where compression fails. We also show that neither K_m nor the number of instructions used shows any correlation with Bennett's Logical Depth LD(s) other than what's predicted by the theory. The agreement between theory and numerical calculations shows that despite the undecidability of these theoretical measures, approximations are stable and meaningful, even for small programs and for short strings.

In terms of parameterized complexity theory, the problem is fixed-parameter linear parameterized by k.   * We show that it is not expressible in monadic second-order logic whether a hypergraph has bounded (fractional, generalized) hypertree width. The proof leads us to conjecture that, in terms of parameterized complexity theory, these problems are W[1]-hard parameterized by the incidence treewidth (the treewidth of the incidence graph).   Thus, in the form of the Myhill-Nerode theorem for hypergraphs, we obtain a method to derive linear-time algorithms and to obtain indicators for intractability for hypergraph problems parameterized by incidence treewidth.

We propose two algorithms respectively based on the recursive method and on an unranking approach. We show how careful implementations of these algorithms allow for a non-redundant generation of $k$ words of length $n$ in $\mathcal{O}(k\cdot n\cdot \log{n})$ arithmetic operations, after a precomputation of $\Theta(n)$ numbers. The overall complexity is therefore dominated by the generation of $k$ words, and the non-redundancy comes at a negligible cost."

Additionally, we describe methods to solve PSPACE-complete automata problems like universality, equivalence and inclusion for much larger instances (1-3 orders of magnitude) than before. This can be used to scale up applications of automata in formal verification tools and decision procedures for logical theories. The algorithm is based on new transition pruning techniques. These use criteria based on combinations of backward and forward trace inclusions. Since these relations are themselves PSPACE-complete, we describe methods to compute good approximations of them in polynomial time. Extensive experiments show that the average-case complexity of our algorithm scales quadratically. The size reduction of the automata depends very much on the class of instances, but our algorithm consistently outperforms all previous techniques by a wide margin. We tested our algorithm on Buchi automata derived from LTL-formulae, many classes of random automata and automata derived from mutual exclusion protocols, and compared its performance to the well-known automata tool GOAL."

WWV is a yearly workshop that aims at providing an interdisciplinary forum to facilitate the cross-fertilization and the advancement of hybrid methods that exploit concepts and tools drawn from Rule-based programming, Software engineering, Formal methods and Web-oriented research. WWV has a reputation for being a lively, friendly forum for presenting and discussing work in progress. The proceedings have been produced after the symposium to allow the authors to incorporate the feedback gathered during the event in the published papers.   All papers submitted to the workshop were reviewed by at least three Program Committee members or external referees. The Program Committee held an electronic discussion leading to the acceptance of all papers for presentation at the workshop.

Our method searches arbitrary regular expressions by matching multiple bytes in parallel using speculation. We partition the input string into chunks, match chunks in parallel, and combine the matching results. Our parallel matching algorithm exploits structural DFA properties to minimize the speculative overhead. Unlike previous approaches, our speculation is failure-free, i.e., (1) sequential semantics are maintained, and (2) speed-downs are avoided altogether. On architectures with a SIMD gather-operation for indexed memory loads, our matching operation is fully vectorized. The proposed load-balancing scheme uses an off-line profiling step to determine the matching capacity of each par- ticipating processor. Based on matching capacities, DFA matches are load-balanced on inhomogeneous parallel architectures such as cloud computing environments. We evaluated our speculative DFA membership test for a representative set of benchmarks from the Perl-compatible Regular Expression (PCRE) library and the PROSITE protein database. Evaluation was conducted on a 4 CPU (40 cores) shared-memory node of the Intel Manycore Testing Lab (Intel MTL), on the Intel AVX2 SDE simulator for 8-way fully vectorized SIMD execution, and on a 20-node (288 cores) cluster on the Amazon EC2 computing cloud."
2012-10-17 23:53:30+00:00,2012-10-17 23:53:30+00:00,"Most scripting languages nowadays use regex pattern-matching libraries. These regex libraries borrow the syntax of regular expressions, but have an informal semantics that is different from the semantics of regular expressions, removing the commutativity of alternation and adding ad-hoc extensions that cannot be expressed by formalisms for efficient recognition of regular languages, such as deterministic finite automata.   Parsing Expression Grammars are a formalism that can describe all deterministic context-free languages and has a simple computational model. In this paper, we present a formalization of regexes via transformation to Parsing Expression Grammars. The proposed transformation easily accommodates several of the common regex extensions, giving a formal meaning to them. It also provides a clear computational model that helps to estimate the efficiency of regex-based matchers, and a basis for specifying provably correct optimizations for them."

As there are uncount- ably many deterministic finite automata in this setting, we restrict our attention to automata with semilinear transition function. The main re- sults is a minimization procedure for semilinear automata. The proof is subtle and refers to decidability of existential Presburger arithmetic with divisibility predicates.

As opposed to several existing works on this topic, we consider DTA with multiple clocks. Our key contribution is an algorithm to approximate these probabilities using finite difference methods. An error bound is provided which indicates the approximation error.

The novelty of our approach is that the non-recursive program we compute may capture unboundedly many behaviors of the original recursive program for which stack usage cannot be bounded. Moreover, we identify a class of recursive programs on which our method terminates and returns the precise summary relations without underapproximation. Doing so, we generalize a similar result for non-recursive programs to the recursive case. Finally, we present experimental results of an implementation of our method applied on a number of examples."

Unfortunately, the lack of a canonical precise framework for fault-tolerant algorithms is an obstacle for both verification and deployment. In this paper, we introduce a new domain-specific framework to capture the behavior of fault-tolerant distributed algorithms in an adequate and precise way. At the center of our framework is a parameterized system model where control flow automata are used for process specification. To account for the specific features and properties of fault-tolerant distributed algorithms for message-passing systems, our control flow automata are extended to model threshold guards as well as the inherent non-determinism stemming from asynchronous communication, interleavings of steps, and faulty processes.   We demonstrate the adequacy of our framework in a representative case study where we formalize a family of well-known fault-tolerant broadcasting algorithms under a variety of failure assumptions. Our case study is supported by model checking experiments with safety and liveness specifications for a fixed number of processes. In the experiments, we systematically varied the assumptions on both the resilience condition and the failure model. In all cases, our experiments coincided with the theoretical results predicted in the distributed algorithms literature. This is giving clear evidence for the adequacy of our model.   In a companion paper, we are addressing the new model checking techniques necessary for parametric verification of the distributed algorithms captured in our framework."

Amethyst is not only a generator of parsers of programming languages, but can also serve as an alternative to tools for matching regular expressions.   Our framework also produces dynamic parsers. Its intended use is in the context of IDE (accurate syntax highlighting and error detection on the fly). Amethyst offers pattern matching of general data structures. This makes it a useful tool for implementing compiler optimizations such as constant folding, instruction scheduling, and dataflow analysis in general.   The parsers produced are essentially top-down parsers. Linear time complexity is obtained by introducing the novel notion of structured grammars and regularized regular expressions. Amethyst uses techniques known from compiler optimizations to produce effective parsers."

For this purpose, a CPN model of Armstrong's axioms presents and initial FDs considered in the model as initial color set.

The new automata recognize languages of data words (instead of normal words), which beside each its letter from a finite alphabet have a data value from an infinite alphabet. Those data values can be loaded to the stack of the automaton, and later compared with some farther data values on the input. Our main purpose for introducing these automata is that they may help in analyzing normal automata (without data). As an example, we give a proof that deterministic automata with collapse can recognize more languages than deterministic automata without collapse. This proof is simpler than in the no-data case. We also state a hypothesis how the new automaton model can be related to the original model of higher-order pushdown automata."

Both the equational theory of KAT and the encoding of PHL in KAT are known to be decidable. In this paper we present a new decision procedure for the equivalence of two KAT expressions based on the notion of partial derivatives.

However, the strictness of the alternation hierarchy does not necessarily carry over when considering restricted classes of structures. A prominent instance is the class of infinite words over which the alternation-free fragment is already as expressive as the full mu-calculus. Our current understanding of when and why the mu-calculus alternation hierarchy is not strict is limited. This paper makes progress in answering these questions by showing that the alternation hierarchy of the mu-calculus collapses to the alternation-free fragment over some classes of structures, including infinite nested words and finite graphs with feedback vertex sets of a bounded size. Common to these classes is that the connectivity between the components in a structure from such a class is restricted in the sense that the removal of certain vertices from the structure's graph decomposes it into graphs in which all paths are of finite length. Our collapse results are obtained in an automata-theoretic setting. They subsume, generalize, and strengthen several prior results on the expressivity of the mu-calculus over restricted classes of structures."

Upon schema evolution, or when exchanging documents among different collections exploiting related but not identical schemas, the need may arise of adapting a document, known to be valid for a given schema S, to a target schema S'. The adaptation may require knowledge of the element semantics and cannot always be automatically derived. In this paper, we present an automata-based method for the static analysis of user-defined XML document adaptations, expressed as sequences of XQuery Update update primitives. The key feature of the method is the use of an automatic inference method for extracting the type, expressed as a Hedge Automaton, of a sequence of document updates. The type is computed starting from the original schema S and from rewriting rules that formally define the operational semantics of a sequence of document updates. Type inclusion can then be used as conformance test w.r.t. the type extracted from the target schema S'."

For an automaton A another automaton A_min with the minimal number of states is learned with the help of a SAT-solver.   This is done by successively computing automata A' that approximate A in the sense that they accept a given finite set of positive examples and reject a given finite set of negative examples. In the course of the procedure these example sets are successively increased. Thus, our method can be seen as an instance of a generic learning algorithm based on a ""minimally adequate teacher"" in the sense of Angluin.   We use a SAT solver to find an NBA for given sets of positive and negative examples. We use complementation via construction of deterministic parity automata to check candidates computed in this manner for equivalence with A. Failure of equivalence yields new positive or negative examples. Our method proved successful on complete samplings of small automata and of quite some examples of bigger automata.   We successfully ran the minimization on over ten thousand automata with mostly up to ten states, including the complements of all possible automata with two states and alphabet size three and discuss results and runtimes; single examples had over 100 states."

To this end we decided to specialize some variables of the HIOAs whose values are functions both of time and space. We call them world variables. Basically they are treated similarly to the other variables of HIOAs, but they have the function of representing the interaction of each automaton with the surrounding environment, hence they can be output, input or internal variables. Since these special variables have the role of simulating implicit communication, their dynamics are specified both in time and space, because they model the perturbations induced by the agent to the environment, and the perturbations of the environment as perceived by the agent. Parallel composition of world variables is slightly different from parallel composition of the other variables, since their signals are summed. The theory is illustrated through a simple example of agents systems."

This construction directly yields decidability of bisimilarity for pPDA, as well as an elementary upper bound for the bisimilarity problem on the subclass of probabilistic basic process algebras, i.e., single-state pPDA. We further show that, with careful analysis, the general reduction can be used to prove an EXPTIME upper bound for bisimilarity of probabilistic visibly pushdown automata. Here we also provide a matching lower bound, establishing EXPTIME-completeness. Finally we prove that deciding bisimilarity of probabilistic one-counter automata, another subclass of pPDA, is PSPACE-complete.

We discuss different E-valued recursively enumerable languages from width-first and depth-first recognition. We find that width-first recognition is equal to or less than depth-first recognition in general. The equivalence requires an underlying E value lattice to degenerate into an MV algebra. We also study variants of ENTMs. ENTMs with a classical initial state and ENTMs with a classical final state have the same power as ENTMs with quantum initial and final states. In particular, the latter can be simulated by ENTMs with classical transitions under a certain condition. Using these findings, we prove that ENTMs are not equivalent to EDTMs and that ENTMs are more powerful than EDTMs. This is a notable difference from the classical Turing machines."

We exploit a bijection between factors of Sturmian words and subintervals of the unitary segment that allows us to study the periods of abelian repetitions by using classical results of elementary Number Theory. We prove that in any Sturmian word the superior limit of the ratio between the maximal exponent of an abelian repetition of period $m$ and $m$ is a number $\geq\sqrt{5}$, and the equality holds for the Fibonacci infinite word. We further prove that the longest prefix of the Fibonacci infinite word that is an abelian repetition of period $F_j$, $j>1$, has length $F_j(F_{j+1}+F_{j-1} +1)-2$ if $j$ is even or $F_j(F_{j+1}+F_{j-1})-2$ if $j$ is odd. This allows us to give an exact formula for the smallest abelian periods of the Fibonacci finite words. More precisely, we prove that for $j\geq 3$, the Fibonacci word $f_j$ has abelian period equal to $F_n$, where $n = \lfloor{j/2}\rfloor$ if $j = 0, 1, 2\mod{4}$, or $n = 1 + \lfloor{j/2}\rfloor$ if $ j = 3\mod{4}$."

Behavioural equivalence in dialgebras is determined by how a given process interacts with the others, and the obtained observations. We develop a technique to inter-define categories of dialgebras of different functors, that in particular permits us to compare a standard coalgebraic semantics and its dialgebraic counterpart. We exemplify the framework using the CCS and the pi-calculus. Remarkably, the dialgebra giving semantics to the pi-calculus does not require the use of presheaf categories."

Alloy models can be automatically verified within a bounded scope using off-the-shelf SAT solvers. Since false assertions can usually be disproved using small counter-examples, this approach suffices for most applications. Unfortunately, it can sometimes lead to a false sense of security, and in critical applications a more traditional unbounded proof may be required. The automatic theorem prover Prover9 has been shown to be particularly effective for proving theorems of relation algebras [7], a quantifier-free (or point-free) axiomatization of a fragment of relational logic. In this paper we propose a translation from Alloy specifications to fork algebras (an extension of relation algebras with the same expressive power as relational logic) which enables their unbounded verification in Prover9. This translation covers not only logic assertions, but also the structural aspects (namely type declarations), and was successfully implemented and applied to several examples."

The idea of the second example belongs to Alexandr V. Korlyukov. He considered an interpreter simulating the dynamic of the well known missionaries-cannibals puzzle. Supercompilation of the interpreter allows us to solve the puzzle. The interpreter may also be seen as an encoding of a non-deterministic protocol.

We show that TOPL automata are equally expressive to register automata and yet suitable to express properties of programs. Compared to other runtime verification methods, our technique can handle a class of properties beyond the reach of current tools. We show in particular that properties which require value updates are not expressible with current techniques yet are naturally captured by TOPL machines. On the practical side, we present a tool for runtime verification of Java programs via TOPL properties, where the trade-off between the coverage and the overhead of the monitoring system is tunable by means of a number of parameters.

We distinguish strategies with different degrees of lookahead, among them being the continuous and the bounded lookahead strategies. In the first case the lookahead is of finite possibly unbounded size, whereas in the second case it is of bounded size. We show that for regular infinite games the solvability by continuous strategies is decidable, and that a continuous strategy can always be reduced to one of bounded lookahead. Moreover, this lookahead is at most doubly exponential in the size of a given parity automaton recognizing the winning condition.

The distinctive feature of our machines is their use of unbounded memory sets (histories) where input symbols can be selectively stored and compared with symbols to follow. In addition, stored symbols can be consumed or deleted by reset.

With a further elaborate argument, we prove a similar but slightly weaker result for bounded-error one-way quantum finite automata with advice. Immediate applications of those properties lead to containments and separations among various language families when they are assisted by appropriately chosen advice. We further demonstrate the power and limitation of randomized advice and quantum advice when they are given to one-way quantum finite automata."

Starting from a sublevel set that includes the origin in its interior, the proposed algorithm iteratively constructs the bisimulation quotient for any larger sublevel set. The bisimulation quotient can then be further used for synthesis of the switching law and system verification with respect to specifications given as syntactically co-safe Linear Temporal Logic formulas over the observed polytopic subsets."

We show that the syntactic composition of two stt computes the composition of the tree transformations computed by each stt, provided that (1) the first one is deterministic or the second one is linear and (2) the first one is total or the second is nondeleting. We consider forward application and backward application of stt and prove that the backward application of an stt to any s-recognizable tree language yields an s-recognizable tree language. We give a linear stt of which the range is not an s-recognizable tree language. We show that the forward application of simple and linear stt preserves s-recognizability. As a corollary, we obtain that the type checking problem of simple and linear stt and the inverse type checking problem of arbitrary stt is decidable."

The classification of cancer progression using discrete states like stages and hallmarks has become common in the biology literature, but primarily as an organizing principle, and not as an executable formalism. The precise computational model developed here aims to exploit this untapped potential, namely, through automatic verification of progression models (e.g., consistency, causal connections, etc.), classification of unreachable or unstable states and computer-generated (individualized or universal) therapy plans. The paper builds on a phenomenological approach, and as such does not need to assume a model for the biochemistry of the underlying natural progression. Rather, it abstractly models transition timings between states as well as the effects of drugs and clinical tests, and thus allows formalization of temporal statements about the progression as well as notions of timed therapies. The model proposed here is ultimately based on hybrid automata, and we show how existing controller synthesis algorithms can be generalized to CHA models, so that therapies can be generated automatically. Throughout this paper we use cancer hallmarks to represent the discrete states through which cancer progresses, but other notions of discretely or continuously varying state formalisms could also be used to derive similar therapies."

Continuity of composition (under certain restrictions) and inversion, as well as closedness of the set of surjective automata, are proved, and some counterexamples are given. We then generalize this space, in the sense that every shift-invariant measure on the configuration space induces a pseudometric on cellular automata, and study the properties of these spaces.

We first investigate the computational capabilities of cellular automaton transducers by comparing them to iterative array transducers, that is, we compare parallel input/output mode to sequential input/output mode of massively parallel machines. By direct simulations, it turns out that the parallel mode is not weaker than the sequential one. Moreover, with regard to certain time complexities cellular automaton transducers are even more powerful than iterative arrays. In the second part of the paper, the model in question is compared with the sequential devices single-valued finite state transducers and deterministic pushdown transducers. It turns out that both models can be simulated by cellular automaton transducers faster than by iterative array transducers."

In 1978, Sakoda and Sipser posed the question of the cost, in the number of the states, of the simulation of one-way and two-way nondeterministic automata by two-way deterministic automata. They conjectured that these costs are exponential. In spite of all attempts to solve it, this question is still open.

They often exhibit a huge number of different behaviors, as soon as the active entities (peers, agents, processes, etc) behave in an asynchronous manner. Already the modelization of such systems is a non-trivial task, let alone their formal verification.   The purpose of this paper is to discuss the problem of distributed monitoring on a simple model of finite-state distributed automata based on shared actions, called asynchronous automata. Monitoring is a question related to runtime verification: assume that we have to check a property $L$ against an unknown or very complex system $A$, so that classical static analysis is not possible. Therefore instead of model-checking a monitor is used, that checks the property on the underlying system at runtime.   We are interested here in monitoring distributed systems modeled as asynchronous automata. It is natural to require that monitors should be of the same kind as the underlying system, so we consider here distributed monitoring. A distributed monitor does not have a global view of the system, therefore we propose the notion of locally monitorable trace language. Our main result shows that if the distributed alphabet of actions is connected and if $L$ is a set of infinite traces such that both $L$ and its complement $L^c$ are countable unions of locally safety languages, then $L$ is locally monitorable. We also show that over infinite traces, recognizable countable unions of locally safety languages are precisely the complements of deterministic languages."

A claimed converse simulation for returning mode (Balan 2009) turned out to be incomplete (Otto 2012) and a language was suggested for separating these PCPA of degree two (number of pushdown automata) from nondeterministic one-way two-head pushdown automata. We show that the suggested language can be accepted by the latter computational model. We present a different example over a single letter alphabet indeed ruling out the possibility of a simulation between the models. The open question about the power of centralized PCPA working in returning mode is then settled by showing them to be universal. Since the construction is possible using systems of degree two, this also improves the previous bound three for generating all recursively enumerable languages. Finally PCPAs are restricted in such a way that a simulation by multi-head automata is possible."

Using this algebraic approach, we show that the quantifier alternation hierarchy inside FO^{2}[<] is decidable within one unit. For this purpose, we relate each level of the hierarchy with decidable varieties of languages, which can be defined in terms of iterated deterministic and co-deterministic products.

Many solutions to this problem have been proposed, including restricting the type of weights used and employing a different valuation function that forces convergence. In this paper we describe an alternative approach that, rather than seeking to avoid the inevitable divergences, instead embraces them as a source of useful information. Specifically, rather than taking coefficients from an arbitrary semiring S we instead take them from S^N. Doing this is useful because it gives us information about how the weight of an infinite word does or does not diverge, and if it does diverge what form the divergence takes --- e.g., polynomial, exponential, etc. This approach has proved to be incredibly useful in the field of quantum simulation because when studying infinite systems, information about how quantities of interest, such as energy or magnetization, diverge is exactly what we want.   In this paper we introduce a new kind of automaton which we call a diverging automaton that maps infinite words to sequences of weights from a semiring and which employs a Buchi-like boundary condition. We then develop a theory for diverging power series and prove a Kleene Theorem connecting rational diverging power series to diverging automata. Afterward we repeat this process by introducing bidiverging automata which map biinfinite words to elements in S^(Z x N), developing a theory for bidiverging power series, and proving another Kleene Theorem. We conclude by describing how bidiverging automata are applied to simulate biinfinite quantum systems."

While global rules, as in CLS, are applied anywhere in a given term, local rules can only be applied in the compartment on which they are defined. Local rules are dynamic: they can be added, moved and erased. We enrich the new calculus with a parallel semantics where a reduction step is lead by any number of global and local rules that could be performed in parallel. A type system is developed to enforce the property that a compartment must contain only local rules with specific features. As a running example we model some interactions happening in a cell starting from its nucleus and moving towards its mitochondria."

In this work, we introduce \emph{automata with delay blocks} (ADBs), extending finite state automata with variable time delay blocks, for deferring individual transition output symbols, in a discrete-time setting. We show that the ADB languages strictly subsume the regular languages, and are incomparable in expressive power to the context-free languages. We show that ADBs are closed under union, concatenation and Kleene star, and under intersection with regular languages, but not closed under complementation and intersection with other ADB languages. We show that the emptiness and the membership problems are decidable in polynomial time for ADBs, whereas the universality problem is undecidable. Finally we consider the linear-time model checking problem, i.e., whether the language of an ADB is contained in a regular language, and show that the model checking problem is PSPACE-complete."

In this context, a first problem is the determinization of TAIOs, which is necessary to foresee next enabled actions after an observable trace, but is in general impossible because not all timed automata are determinizable. This problem is solved thanks to an approximate determinization using a game approach. The algorithm performs an io-abstraction which preserves the tioco conformance relation and thus guarantees the soundness of generated test cases. A second problem is the selection of test cases from a TAIO specification. The selection here relies on a precise description of timed behaviors to be tested which is carried out by expressive test purposes modeled by a generalization of TAIOs. Finally, an algorithm is described which generates test cases in the form of TAIOs equipped with verdicts, using a symbolic co-reachability analysis guided by the test purpose. Properties of test cases are then analyzed with respect to the precision of the approximate determinization: when determinization is exact, which is the case on known determinizable classes, in addition to soundness, properties characterizing the adequacy of test cases verdicts are also guaranteed."

This allows to model hardware imprecision and therefore it has been applied to determine implementability of timed automata. In a recent paper, we extend this problem to a specification theory for real-timed systems based on timed input/output automata, that are interpreted as two-player games. We propose a construction that allows to synthesize an implementation of a specification that is robust under a given timed perturbation, and we study the impact of these perturbations when composing different specifications.   To complete this work we present a technique that evaluates the greatest admissible perturbation. It consists in an iterative process that extracts a spoiling strategy when a game is lost, and through a parametric analysis refines the admissible values for the perturbation. We demonstrate this approach with a prototype implementation."

In this paper, we show that if we use architecturally restricted verifiers instead of restricting the working memory, i.e. replacing the working tape(s) with a single counter, we can define some IPS's for each decidable language. Such verifiers are called two-way probabilistic one-counter automata (2pca's). Then, we show that by adding a fixed-size quantum memory to a 2pca, called a two-way one-counter automaton with quantum and classical states (2qcca), the protocol can be space efficient. As a further result, if the 2qcca can use a quantum counter instead of a classical one, then the protocol can even be public, also known as Arthur-Merlin games.   We also investigate the computational power of 2pca's and 2qcca's as language recognizers. We show that bounded-error 2pca's can be more powerful than their deterministic counterparts by giving a bounded-error simulation of their nondeterministic counterparts. Then, we present a new programming technique for bounded-error 2qcca's and show that they can recognize a language which seems not to be recognized by any bounded-error 2pca. We also obtain some interesting results for bounded-error 1-pebble quantum finite automata based on this new technique. Lastly, we prove a conjecture posed by Ravikumar (FSTTCS 1992) regarding 1-pebble probabilistic finite automata, i.e. they can recognize some nonstochastic languages with bounded error."

We first translate the given LTL formula into a special disjuctive-normal form (DNF). The formula will be part of the state, and its DNF normal form specifies the atomic properties that should hold immediately (labels of the transitions) and the formula that should hold afterwards (the corresponding successor state). Surprisingly, if the given formula is Until-free or Release-free, the Buechi automaton can be obtained directly in this manner. For a general formula, the construction is slightly involved: an additional component will be needed for each formula that helps us to identify the set of accepting states. Notably, our construction is an on-the-fly construction, and the resulting Buechi automaton has in worst case 2^{2n+1} states where n denotes the number of subformulas. Moreover, it has a better bound 2^{n+1} when the formula is Until- (or Release-) free."

Various notions of non-interference have been defined in the literature, and in this paper we focus on Strong Non-deterministic Non-Interference (SNNI) and two (bi)simulation based variants thereof (CSNNI and BSNNI). We consider timed non-interference properties for timed systems specified by timed automata and we study the two following problems: (1) check whether it is possible to find a sub-system so that it is non-interferent; if yes (2) compute a (largest) sub-system which is non-interferent."
2012-07-10 13:13:35+00:00,2012-07-10 13:13:35+00:00,"We investigate the computational power of periodically iterated morphisms, also known as D0L systems with periodic control, PD0L systems for short. These systems give rise to a class of one-sided infinite sequences, called PD0L words.   We construct a PD0L word with exponential subword complexity, thereby answering a question raised by Lepisto (1993) on the existence of such words. We solve another open problem concerning the decidability of the first-order theories of PD0L words; we show it is already undecidable whether a certain letter occurs in a PD0L word. This stands in sharp contrast to the situation for D0L words (purely morphic words), which are known to have at most quadratic subword complexity, and for which the monadic theory is decidable.   The main result of our paper, leading to these answers, is that every computable word w over an alphabet Sigma can be embedded in a PD0L word u over an extended alphabet Gamma in the following two ways: (i) such that every finite prefix of w is a subword of u, and (ii) such that w is obtained from u by erasing all letters from Gamma not in Sigma. The PD0L system generating such a word u is constructed by encoding a Fractran program that computes the word w; Fractran is a programming language as powerful as Turing Machines.   As a consequence of (ii), if we allow the application of finite state transducers to PD0L words, we obtain the set of all computable words. Thus the set of PD0L words is not closed under finite state transduction, whereas the set of D0L words is. It moreover follows that equality of PD0L words (given by their PD0L system) is undecidable. Finally, we show that if erasing morphisms are admitted, then the question of productivity becomes undecidable, that is, the question whether a given PD0L system defines an infinite word."

The idea of Layered Fault Tolerant Specification (LFTS) is proposed to make the method extensible to fault tolerant systems. The principle is layering the specification in different levels, the first one for the normal behavior and the others for the abnormal. The abnormal behavior is described in terms of an Error Injector (EI), which represents a model of the erroneous interference coming from the environment. This structure has been inspired by the notion of idealized fault tolerant component but the combination of LFTS and EI using Rely/Guarantee reasoning to describe their interaction can be considered as a novel contribution. The progress toward this method and this way to organize fault tolerant specifications has been made experimenting on case studies and an example is presented."

They improved the previous decidability result of Christensen, H\""uttel, Stirling (1992), since their procedure has obviously an elementary time complexity and the authors claim that a close analysis would reveal a double exponential upper bound. Here a self-contained direct proof of the membership in 2-ExpTime is given. This is done via a Prover-Refuter game which shows that there is an alternating Turing machine deciding the problem in exponential space. The proof uses similar ingredients (size-measures, decompositions, bases) as the previous proofs, but one new simplifying factor is an explicit addition of infinite regular strings to the state space. An auxiliary claim also shows an explicit exponential upper bound on the equivalence level of nonbisimilar normed BPA processes. The importance of clarifying the 2-ExpTime upper bound for BPA bisimilarity has recently increased due to the shift of the known lower bound from PSpace (Srba, 2002) to ExpTime (Kiefer, 2012)."

Although solutions to these problems are intractable in general, there might be special cases, such as structured POMDPs, which can be solved efficiently. A natural and possibly efficient way to represent a POMDP is through the predictive state representation (PSR) - a representation which recently has been receiving increasing attention. In this work, we relate POMDPs to multiplicity automata- showing that POMDPs can be represented by multiplicity automata with no increase in the representation size. Furthermore, we show that the size of the multiplicity automaton is equal to the rank of the predictive state representation. Therefore, we relate both the predictive state representation and POMDPs to the well-founded multiplicity automata literature. Based on the multiplicity automata representation, we provide a planning algorithm which is exponential only in the multiplicity automata rank rather than the number of states of the POMDP. As a result, whenever the predictive state representation is logarithmic in the standard POMDP representation, our planning algorithm is efficient."

2012-07-04 01:21:48+00:00,2012-07-04 01:21:48+00:00,"We consider the problem of obtaining sparse positional strategies for safety games. Such games are a commonly used model in many formal methods, as they make the interaction of a system with its environment explicit. Often, a winning strategy for one of the players is used as a certificate or as an artefact for further processing in the application. Small such certificates, i.e., strategies that can be written down very compactly, are typically preferred. For safety games, we only need to consider positional strategies. These map game positions of a player onto a move that is to be taken by the player whenever the play enters that position. For representing positional strategies compactly, a common goal is to minimize the number of positions for which a winning player's move needs to be defined such that the game is still won by the same player, without visiting a position with an undefined next move. We call winning strategies in which the next move is defined for few of the player's positions sparse.   Unfortunately, even roughly approximating the density of the sparsest strategy for a safety game has been shown to be NP-hard. Thus, to obtain sparse strategies in practice, one either has to apply some heuristics, or use some exhaustive search technique, like ILP (integer linear programming) solving. In this paper, we perform a comparative study of currently available methods to obtain sparse winning strategies for the safety player in safety games. We consider techniques from common knowledge, such as using ILP or SAT (satisfiability) solving, and a novel technique based on iterative linear programming. The results of this paper tell us if current techniques are already scalable enough for practical use."

We prove the conservativeness of these extensions, and also prove that they work with any left-recursive PEG.   PEGs can also be compiled to programs in a low-level parsing machine.

2012-06-22 15:13:32+00:00,2013-11-03 20:57:32+00:00,"We recently introduced p-automata, automata that read discrete-time Markov chains. We used turn-based stochastic parity games to define acceptance of Markov chains by a subclass of p-automata. Definition of acceptance required a cumbersome and complicated reduction to a series of turn-based stochastic parity games. The reduction could not support acceptance by general p-automata, which was left undefined as there was no notion of games that supported it.   Here we generalize two-player games by adding a structural acceptance condition called obligations. Obligations are orthogonal to the linear winning conditions that define winning. Obligations are a declaration that player 0 can achieve a certain value from a configuration. If the obligation is met, the value of that configuration for player 0 is 1.   One cannot define value in obligation games by the standard mechanism of considering the measure of winning paths on a Markov chain and taking the supremum of the infimum of all strategies. Mainly because obligations need definition even for Markov chains and the nature of obligations has the flavor of an infinite nesting of supremum and infimum operators. We define value via a reduction to turn-based games similar to Martin's proof of determinacy of Blackwell games with Borel objectives. Based on this definition, we show that games are determined. We show that for Markov chains with Borel objectives and obligations, and finite turn-based stochastic parity games with obligations there exists an alternative and simpler characterization of the value function. Based on this simpler definition we give an exponential time algorithm to analyze finite turn-based stochastic parity games with obligations. Finally, we show that obligation games provide the necessary framework for reasoning about p-automata and that they generalize the previous definition."

I consider structured excitable media, in which excitations are constrained to propagate only in defined narrow channels, and cannot propagate elsewhere. I define a type of transition system that can be used to describe the complete set of behaviours exhibited by simple structures. The composition rules that result from this definition can be used to automatically deduce the behaviour of more complex structures composed from simpler structures. Several examples illustrate the method, and a software implementation is provided."

Finally we present an empirical performance analysis that compares these two algorithms, focussing on learning times and different types of learning queries. We conclude that IDS is an efficient algorithm for software engineering applications of automata learning, such as testing and model inference."

These models are of particular interest,as they show praiseworthy advantages over the fully quantum models in some nontrivial aspects. This paper characterizes these models in a uniform framework by proposing a general hybrid model consisting of a quantum component and a classical one which can interact with each other. The existing hybrid QFA can be naturally regarded as the general model with specific communication patterns (classical-quantum, quantum-classical, and two-way, respectively). We further clarify the relationship between these hybrid QFA and some other quantum models. In particular, it is shown that hybrid QFA can be simulated exactly by QFA with quantum operations, which in turn has a close relationship with two early proposed models: {\it ancialla QFA} and {\it quantum sequential machines}."

We show that this probability can be compared with any rational number in PSPACE, and with 0 and 1 in polynomial time. In a second part, we suggest a tree extension of the logic PCTL, and develop a PSPACE algorithm for model checking a branching process against a formula of this logic.

We consider here boolean programs with a finite number of threads and recursive procedures. It is well-known that the model checking problem is undecidable for this class of programs. In this paper, we investigate the decidability and the complexity of this problem under the assumption of bounded context-switching defined by Qadeer and Rehof, and of phase-boundedness proposed by La Torre et al. On the model checking of such systems against temporal logics and in particular branching time logics such as the modal $\mu$-calculus or CTL has received little attention. It is known that parity games, which are closely related to the modal $\mu$-calculus, are decidable for the class of bounded-phase systems (and hence for bounded-context switching as well), but with non-elementary complexity (Seth). A natural question is whether this high complexity is inevitable and what are the ways to get around it. This paper addresses these questions and unfortunately, and somewhat surprisingly, it shows that branching model checking for MPDSs is inherently an hard problem with no easy solution. We show that parity games on MPDS under phase-bounding restriction is non-elementary. Our main result shows that model checking a $k$ context bounded MPDS against a simple fragment of CTL, consisting of formulas that whose temporal operators come from the set ${\EF, \EX}$, has a non-elementary lower bound."

The proof techniques to handle the zero-test are based on two new notions of cover: the refined and the filtered cover. The refined cover is a hybrid between the reachability set and the classical cover. It inherits properties of the reachability set: equality of two refined covers is undecidable, even for usual Vector Addition Systems (with no zero-test), but the refined cover of a Vector Addition System is a recursive set. The second notion of cover, called the filtered cover, is the central tool of our algorithms. It inherits properties of the classical cover, and in particular, one can effectively compute a finite representation of this set, even for Vector Addition Systems with one zero-test."

The resulting nonlinear dynamical automata (NDA) are piecewise affine-linear maps acting on the unit square that is partitioned into rectangular domains. Iterating a single point, i.e. a microstate, by the dynamics yields a trajectory of, in principle, infinitely many points scattered through phase space. Therefore, the NDAs microstate dynamics does not necessarily terminate in contrast to its counterpart, the symbolic dynamics obtained from the rectangular partition. In order to regain the proper symbolic interpretation, one has to prepare ensembles of randomly distributed microstates with rectangular supports. Only the resulting macrostate evolution corresponds then to the original Turing machine computation. However, the introduction of random initial conditions into a deterministic dynamics is not really satisfactory. As a possible solution for this problem we suggest a change of perspective. Instead of looking at point dynamics in phase space, we consider functional dynamics of probability distributions functions (p.d.f.s) over phase space. This is generally described by a Frobenius-Perron integral transformation that can be regarded as a neural field equation over the unit square as feature space of a dynamic field theory (DFT). Solving the Frobenius-Perron equation, yields that uniform p.d.f.s with rectangular support are mapped onto uniform p.d.f.s with rectangular support, again. Thus, the symbolically meaningful NDA macrostate dynamics becomes represented by iterated function dynamics in DFT; hence we call the resulting representation dynamic field automata."

Then a determinization procedure such as of Safra is performed yielding a deterministic \omega-automaton. We present a direct translation of the (F,G)-fragment of LTL into deterministic \omega-automata with no determinization procedure involved.

We then show how to enumerate strings generated by an unambiguous context-free grammar using the Chomsky-Sch\""utzenberger theorem. This theorem allows one to construct an algebraic equation whose power series expansion provides the enumeration. Classical tools from complex analysis, such as singularity analysis, can then be used to determine the asymptotic behavior of the enumeration.   We use these algebraic and analytic methods to obtain asymptotic estimates on the number of regular expressions of size n.

In order to study the structure of the subvarieties of DA, Trotter and Weil considered the intersection of varieties of finite monoids with bands, i.e., with idempotent monoids. The varieties of idempotent monoids are very well understood and fully classified. Trotter and Weil showed that for every band variety V there exists a unique maximal variety W inside DA such that the intersection with bands yields the given band variety V. These maximal varieties W define the Trotter-Weil hierarchy. This hierarchy is infinite and it exhausts DA; induced by band varieties, it naturally has a zigzag shape. In their paper, Trotter and Weil have shown that the corners and the intersection levels of this hierarchy are decidable.   In this paper, we give a single identity of omega-terms for every join level of the Trotter-Weil hierarchy; this yields decidability. Moreover, we show that the join levels and the subsequent intersection levels do not coincide. Almeida and Azevedo have shown that the join of R-trivial and L-trivial finite monoids is decidable; this is the first non-trivial join level of the Trotter-Weil hierarchy. We extend this result to the other join levels of the Trotter-Weil hierarchy. At the end of the paper, we give two applications. First, we show that the hierarchy of deterministic and codeterministic products is decidable. And second, we show that the direction alternation depth of unambiguous interval logic is decidable."

We show that k+1 set quantifier alternations allow to define a picture language that cannot be defined using k set quantifier alternations preceded by arbitrarily many first-order quantifier alternations. The approach uses, for a given picture language L and an integer m > 0 the height-m fragment of L, which is defined as the word language obtained by considering each picture p of height m in L as a word, where the letters of that word are the columns of p. A key idea is to measure the complexity of a regular word language by the group complexity of its syntactic monoid. Given a picture language L, such a word language measure may be applied to each of its height fragments, so that the complexity of the picture language is a function that maps each m to the complexity of the height-m fragment of L. The asymptotic growth rate of that function may be bounded based on the structure of a monadic second-order formula that defines L. The core argument for that lower bound proof is based on Straubing's algebraic characterization of the effect of first-order quantifiers on the syntactic monoid of word languages by means of Rhodes' and Tilson's block product."

However, currently there is no tree automata library implementation that would provide an efficient and flexible support for such methods. Thus the aim of this Master's Thesis is to provide such a library. The present paper first describes the theoretical background of finite tree automata and regular tree languages. Then it surveys the current implementations of tree automata libraries and studies various verification techniques, outlining requirements for the library. Representation of a finite tree automaton and algorithms that perform standard language operations on this representation are proposed in the next part, which is followed by description of library implementation.

While general satisfiability is an intriguing challenge from a purely theoretical point of view, we argue that general solutions would not be of interest to practitioners: such solutions could be too big to be implementable or even infinite. Inspired by bounded synthesis techniques, we turn to the more applied problem of seeking models of a bounded size: we restrict our search to implementable -- and therefore reasonably simple -- models. We propose a procedure to decide whether or not a given PCTL formula has an implementable model by reducing it to an SMT problem. We have implemented our techniques and found that they can be applied to the practical problem of sanity checking -- a procedure that allows a system designer to check whether their formula has an unexpectedly small model."

While the reachability problem is undecidable for hybrid automata we show that it is decidable for ITA. More precisely we prove that the untimed language of an ITA is regular, by building a finite automaton as a generalized class graph. We then establish that the reachability problem for ITA is in NEXPTIME and in PTIME when the number of clocks is fixed. To prove the first result, we define a subclass ITA- of ITA, and show that (1) any ITA can be reduced to a language-equivalent automaton in ITA- and (2) the reachability problem in this subclass is in NEXPTIME (without any class graph). In the next step, we investigate the verification of real time properties over ITA. We prove that model checking SCL, a fragment of a timed linear time logic, is undecidable. On the other hand, we give model checking procedures for two fragments of timed branching time logic. We also compare the expressive power of classical timed automata and ITA and prove that the corresponding families of accepted languages are incomparable. The result also holds for languages accepted by controlled real-time automata (CRTA), that extend timed automata. We finally combine ITA with CRTA, in a model which encompasses both classes and show that the reachability problem is still decidable. Additionally we show that the languages of ITA are neither closed under complementation nor under intersection."

Th\'erien and Wilke have shown that it is decidable whether a given regular language is definable in FO^2[<]. From a practical point of view, as shown by Weis, FO^2[<] is interesting since its satisfiability problem is in NP. Restricting the number of quantifier alternations yields an infinite hierarchy inside the class of FO^2[<]-definable languages. We show that each level of this hierarchy is decidable. For this purpose, we relate each level of the hierarchy with a decidable variety of finite monoids. Our result implies that there are many different ways of climbing up the FO^2[<]-quantifier alternation hierarchy: deterministic and co-deterministic products, Mal'cev products with definite and reverse definite semigroups, iterated block products with J-trivial monoids, and some inductively defined omega-term identities.

The technique is based on local modification of variables (replacing X by aX or Xa) and iterative replacement of pairs of letters appearing in the equation by a `fresh' letter, which can be seen as a bottom-up compression of the solution of the given word equation, to be more specific, building an SLP (Straight-Line Programme) for the solution of the word equation.   Using this technique we give a new, independent and self-contained proofs of most of the known results for word equations. To be more specific, the presented (nondeterministic) algorithm runs in O(n log n) space and in time polynomial in log N, where N is the size of the length-minimal solution of the word equation. The presented algorithm can be easily generalised to a generator of all solutions of the given word equation (without increasing the space usage). Furthermore, a further analysis of the algorithm yields a doubly exponential upper bound on the size of the length-minimal solution. The presented algorithm does not use exponential bound on the exponent of periodicity. Conversely, the analysis of the algorithm yields an independent proof of the exponential bound on exponent of periodicity.   We believe that the presented algorithm, its idea and analysis are far simpler than all previously applied. Furthermore, thanks to it we can obtain a unified and simple approach to most of known results for word equations.   As a small additional result we show that for O(1) variables (with arbitrary many appearances in the equation) word equations can be solved in linear space, i.e. they are context-sensitive."

Since 1964, this problem has been solved for few special classes of \sa. One of this result is due to Kari \cite{Ka03} for automata with Eulerian digraphs.

As a practical test we perform an experimental study of the length of the shortest reset word for random automata with $n$ states and 2 input letters. We follow Skvorsov and Tipikin, who have performed such a study using a SAT solver and considering automata up to $n=100$ states.

We term the first operation as (left or right) \emph{quotient}, and the second as (left or right) \emph{residual}. To support the definitions of quotients and residuals, the underlying semiring is restricted to complete semirings or complete c-semirings. Algebraical properties that are similar to the classical case are obtained in the formal power series case. Moreover, we show closure properties, under quotients and residuals, of regular series and weighted context-free series are similar as in formal languages. Using these operations, we define for each formal power series $A$ two weighted automata ${\cal M}_A$ and ${\cal U}_A$. Both weighted automata accepts $A$, and ${\cal M}_A$ is the minimal deterministic weighted automaton of $A$. The universality of ${\cal U}_A$ is justified and, in particular, we show that ${\cal M}_A$ is a sub-automaton of ${\cal U}_A$. Last but not least, an effective method to construct the universal automaton is also presented in this paper."

These results usually state determinacy, i.e. the existence of a winning strategy in games that involve two players and two outcomes saying who wins. In a multi-outcome setting, the notion of winning strategy is irrelevant yet usually replaced faithfully with the notion of (pure) Nash equilibrium. This article shows that every determinacy result over an arbitrary game structure, e.g. a tree, is transferable into existence of multi-outcome (pure) Nash equilibrium over the same game structure. The equilibrium-transfer theorem requires cardinal or order-theoretic conditions on the strategy sets and the preferences, respectively, whereas counter-examples show that every requirement is relevant, albeit possibly improvable. When the outcomes are finitely many, the proof provides an algorithm computing a Nash equilibrium without significant complexity loss compared to the two-outcome case. As examples of application, this article generalises Borel determinacy, positional determinacy of parity games, and finite-memory determinacy of Muller games."

The central problem in TRMC is to decide whether a set of bad states is reachable. The problem of computing a TA representing (an over- approximation of) the set of reachable states is undecidable, but efficient solutions based on completion or iteration of tree transducers exist. Unfortunately, the TRMC framework is unable to efficiently capture both the complex structure of a system and of some of its features. As an example, for JAVA programs, the structure of a term is mainly exploited to capture the structure of a state of the system. On the counter part, integers of the java programs have to be encoded with Peano numbers, which means that any algebraic operation is potentially represented by thousands of applications of rewriting rules. In this paper, we propose Lattice Tree Automata (LTAs), an extended version of tree automata whose leaves are equipped with lattices. LTAs allow us to represent possibly infinite sets of interpreted terms. Such terms are capable to represent complex domains and related operations in an efficient manner. We also extend classical Boolean operations to LTAs. Finally, as a major contribution, we introduce a new completion-based algorithm for computing the possibly infinite set of reachable interpreted terms in a finite amount of time."

We investigate open and closed trapezoidal words, in relation with their special factors. We prove that Sturmian palindromes are closed trapezoidal words and that a closed trapezoidal word is a Sturmian palindrome if and only if its longest repeated prefix is a palindrome.

Also, in this approach some old concepts come into a new arrangement. The major goal of this article is to introduce an appropriate definition for this purpose. Introduction In Computability Theory (Recursion Theory) in the first step we wish to recognize the sets which could be enumerated by Turing machines (equivalently, algorithms) and in the next step we will compare these sets by some reasonable order (Like Turing degree). Also sometimes with some extra information (Oracles) a class of non c.e. sets show the same behavior as c.e. sets (Post hierarchy and related theorems). Here we try another approach: ""Let A be an arbitrary set and we wish to recognize how much this set might be covered by a c.e. set?"" Although in some sense this approach could be seen in some definitions of Recursion Theory, but at the best of our knowledge it didn't considered as an approach yet, even though it is able to shed a light on some subjects of Computability of sets. Defining this approach is not quite straightforward and there are some obstacles to define them. To overcome these difficulties we modify the definitions. We have an alternative problem here when we consider recursive sets and not c.e. sets. In this case, the problem would be: ""Let A be an arbitrary set and we wish to know that how much this set might be covered by a recursive Set?"" Here, we try the first definition and the first problem."

By applying a method, due to the author, used to deal with the equivalence problem of {\it measure many one-way quantum finite automata}, we also show that a $k_1$-letter measure many quantum finite automaton $\mathcal{A}_1$ and a $k_2$-letter measure many quantum finite automaton $\mathcal{A}_2$ are equivalent if and only if they are $(n_1^2+n_2^2-1)|\Sigma|^{k-1}+k$-equivalent where $n_i$, $i=1,2$, are the numbers of state in $\mathcal{A}_i$ respectively, and $k=\max\{k_1,k_2\}$.   Next, we study the language equivalence problem of those two kinds of quantum finite automata. We show that for $k$-letter quantum finite automata, the non-strict cut-point language equivalence problem is undecidable, i.e., it is undecidable whether $L_{\geq\lambda}(\mathcal{A}_1)=L_{\geq\lambda}(\mathcal{A}_2)$ where $0<\lambda\leq 1$ and $\mathcal{A}_i$ are $k_i$-letter quantum finite automata. Further, we show that both strict and non-strict cut-point language equivalence problem for $k$-letter measure many quantum finite automata are undecidable. The direct consequences of the above outcomes are summarized in the paper.   Finally, we comment on existing proofs about the minimization problem of one way quantum finite automata not only because we have been showing great interest in this kind of problem, which is very important in classical automata theory, but also due to that the problem itself, personally, is a challenge.

In this paper, we also model the mind as a place where a circuit grows, starting as a collection of primitive components at birth and then builds up incrementally in a bottom up fashion. A new node is formed by a simple composition of prior nodes when we undergo a repeated experience that can be described by that composition. Unlike neural networks, however, these circuits take ""concepts"" or ""percepts"" as inputs and outputs.

The theoretical results imply that this problem is highly intractable, e.g., synthesizing a system is 2EXPTIME-complete for an LTL specification, and EXPTIME-complete for a CTL specification. However, an argument against it is that the temporal specification is highly compact, and the complexity reflects the large size of the system constructed. In that respect, the complexity should, perhaps, be specified relative to the size of the minimal satisfying system. A careful observation reveals that the size of the system is presented in such arguments as the size of its state space. This view is a bit nonstandard, in the sense that the state space can be exponentially larger than the size of a reasonable implementation such as a circuit or a program. Although this alternative measure of the size of the synthesized system is more intuitive (e.g., this is the standard way model checking problems are measured), research on synthesis has so far stayed with measuring the system in terms of the explicit state space. This raises the question of whether or not there always exists a small system. In this paper, we show that this is the case if, and only if, PSPACE = EXPTIME."

We continue the study to examine how regular languages behave when they need to cut numerous infinite languages. A particular interest rests on a situation in which a regular language needs to ""dissect"" a given infinite language into two subsets of infinite size. Every context-free language is dissected by carefully chosen regular languages (or it is REG-dissectible). In a larger picture, we show that constantly-growing languages and semi-linear languages are REG-dissectible. Under certain natural conditions, complements and finite intersections of semi-linear languages also become REG-dissectible. Restricted to bounded languages, the intersections of finitely many context-free languages and, more surprisingly, the entire Boolean hierarchy over bounded context-free languages are REG-dissectible. As an immediate application of the REG-dissectibility, we show another structural property, in which an appropriate bounded context-free language can ""separate with infinite margins"" two given nested infinite bounded context-free languages."

We show that these programs also have a decidable complexity property: one can determine whether the length of all transition sequences can be bounded in terms of the initial state. This is the Bounded Termination problem. Interestingly, if a bound exists, it must be polynomial. We prove that the bounded termination problem is PSPACE-complete.   We also discuss, theoretically, the use of bounds on the abstract program to infer conclusions on a concrete program that has been abstracted. The conclusion maybe a polynomial time bound, or in other cases polynomial space or exponential time.

From the standpoint of register automata models, this work aims at two objectives: (1) simplifying the existent decidability proofs for the emptiness problem for alternating register automata; and (2) exhibiting decidable extensions for these models. From the logical perspective, we show that (a) in the case of data words, satisfiability of LTL with one register and quantification over data values is decidable; and (b) the satisfiability problem for the so-called forward fragment of XPath on XML documents is decidable, even in the presence of DTDs and even of key constraints.

Every property that can be expressed in this logic can be checked in polynomial time, and conversely every polynomial-time decidable problem that has a bisimulation-invariant encoding into labeled transition systems can also be defined in the higher-dimensional modal mu-calculus. We exemplify the latter connection by giving several examples of decision problems which reduce to model checking of the higher-dimensional modal mu-calculus for some fixed formulas. This way generic model checking algorithms for the logic can then be used via partial evaluation in order to obtain algorithms for theses problems which may benefit from improvements that are well-established in the field of program verification, namely on-the-fly and symbolic techniques. The aim of this work is to extend such techniques to other fields as well, here exemplarily done for process equivalences, automata theory, parsing, string problems, and games."

We show that over finite words, every logical fragment defines a lattice of languages with certain closure properties. Among these closure properties are residuals and inverse C-morphisms. Here, depending on certain closure properties of the fragment, C is the family of arbitrary, non-erasing, length-preserving, length-multiplying, or length-reducing morphisms. In particular, definability in a certain fragment can often be characterized in terms of the syntactic morphism. This work extends a result of Straubing in which he investigated certain restrictions of first-order logic formulae. In contrast to Straubing's model-theoretic approach, our notion of a logical fragment is purely syntactic and it does not rely on Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse games.   As motivating examples, we present (1) a fragment which captures the stutter-invariant part of piecewise-testable languages and (2) an acyclic fragment of Sigma_2. As it turns out, the latter has the same expressive power as two-variable first-order logic FO^2."

Various interesting examples are presented, including an example of a non-Markov monoid that nevertheless admits a regular language of unique representatives over any generating set. It is shown that all finitely generated commutative semigroups are strongly Markov, but that finitely generated subsemigroups of virtually abelian or polycyclic groups need not be. Potential connections with word-hyperbolic semigroups are investigated. A study is made of the interaction of the classes of Markov and strongly Markov semigroups with direct products, free products, and finite-index subsemigroups and extensions.

Nested pushdown trees are useful representations of control flows in the verification of programs with recursive calls of first-order functions. Higher-order nested pushdown trees are expansions of unfoldings of graphs generated by higher-order pushdown systems. Moreover, the class of nested pushdown trees of level n is uniformly first-order interpretable in the class of collapsible pushdown graphs of level n+1. The relationship between the class of higher-order pushdown graphs and the class of collapsible higher-order pushdown graphs is not very well understood. We hope that the further study of the nested pushdown tree hierarchy leads to a better understanding of these two hierarchies. In this paper, we are concerned with the first-order model checking problem on higher-order nested pushdown trees. We show that the first-order model checking on the first two levels of this hierarchy is decidable. Moreover, we obtain an 2-EXPSPACE algorithm for the class of nested pushdown trees of level 1. The proof technique involves a pseudo-local analysis of strategies in the Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse games on two identical copies of a nested pushdown tree. Ordinary locality arguments in the spirit of Gaifman's lemma do not apply here because nested pushdown trees tend to have small diameters. We introduce the notion of relevant ancestors which provide a sufficient description of the FO_k -type of each element in a higher-order nested pushdown tree. The local analysis of these ancestors allows us to prove the existence of restricted winning strategies in the Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse game. These strategies are then used to create a first-order model checking algorithm."

Also, an important property of this family is that the set of cells of the cellular automaton which are subject to changes is actually a planar set. The problem for $p<13$ for a truly planar construction is still open. The best result, for $p=7$, is four states and was obtained by the same author."

The notion of translation-invariance is also generalized. The definition we provide for these ""causal graph dynamics"" is simple and axiomatic. The theorems we provide also show that it is robust. For instance, causal graph dynamics are stable under composition and under restriction to radius one. In the finite case some fundamental facts of Cellular Automata theory carry through: causal graph dynamics admit a characterization as continuous functions, and they are stable under inversion.

Considering first-order logic without reachability, we prove decidability in doubly exponential alternating time with linearly many alternations. First-order logic with regular reachability predicates is uniformly decidable on level 2 collapsible pushdown graphs. Moreover, nested pushdown trees are first-order interpretable in collapsible pushdown graphs of level 2. This interpretation can be extended to an interpretation of the class of higher-order nested pushdown trees in the collapsible pushdown graph hierarchy. We prove that the second level of this new hierarchy of nested trees has decidable first-order model checking. Our decidability result for collapsible pushdown graph relies on the fact that level 2 collapsible pushdown graphs are uniform tree-automatic. Our last result concerns tree-automatic structures in general. We prove that first-order logic extended by Ramsey quantifiers is decidable on all tree-automatic structures."

An important, though only recently studied special case is that of Time-symmetric Cellular Automata (TSCA), for which G and its inverse are related via a local operation. In this note we revisit the question of the Block representation of RCA, i.e. we provide a very simple proof of the existence of a reversible circuit description implementing G. This operational, bottom-up description of G turns out to be time-symmetric, suggesting interesting connections with TSCA.

Perfect language classes are the basis for the automata-theoretic approach to model checking: a system is correct if the language generated by the system is disjoint from the language of bad traces. Regular languages are perfect, but because the disjointness problem for CFLs is undecidable, no class containing the CFLs can be perfect.   In practice, verification problems for language classes that are not perfect are often under-approximated by checking if the property holds for all behaviors of the system belonging to a fixed subset. A general way to specify a subset of behaviors is by using bounded languages (languages of the form w1* ... wk* for fixed words w1,...,wk). A class of languages C is perfect modulo bounded languages if it is closed under Boolean operations relative to every bounded language, and if the emptiness problem is decidable relative to every bounded language.   We consider finding perfect classes of languages modulo bounded languages. We show that the class of languages accepted by multi-head pushdown automata are perfect modulo bounded languages, and characterize the complexities of decision problems. We also show that bounded languages form a maximal class for which perfection is obtained. We show that computations of several known models of systems, such as recursive multi-threaded programs, recursive counter machines, and communicating finite-state machines can be encoded as multi-head pushdown automata, giving uniform and optimal underapproximation algorithms modulo bounded languages."

In this work we consider solving recursive game graphs (or pushdown game graphs) that can model the control flow of sequential programs with recursion. While pushdown games have been studied before with qualitative objectives, such as reachability and $\omega$-regular objectives, in this work we study for the first time such games with the most well-studied quantitative objective, namely, mean-payoff objectives. In pushdown games two types of strategies are relevant: (1) global strategies, that depend on the entire global history; and (2) modular strategies, that have only local memory and thus does not depend on the context of invocation, but only on the history of the current invocation of the module. Our main results are as follows (1) One-player pushdown games with mean-payoff objectives under global strategies is decidable in polynomial time. (2) Two-player pushdown games with mean-payoff objectives under global strategies is undecidable. (3) One-player pushdown games with mean-payoff objectives under modular strategies is NP-hard. (4) Two-player pushdown games with mean-payoff objectives under modular strategies can be solved in NP (i.e., both one-player and two-player pushdown games with mean-payoff objectives under modular strategies is NP-complete). We also establish the optimal strategy complexity showing that global strategies for mean-payoff objectives require infinite memory even in one-player pushdown games; and memoryless modular strategies are sufficient in two-player pushdown games. Finally we also show that all the problems have the same complexity if the stack boundedness condition is added, where along with the mean-payoff objective the player must also ensure that the stack height is bounded."

Two problems can arise when defining a substitution in such a way: it can fail to be consistent, and the patterns in an image by the substitution might overlap.   We prove that it is undecidable whether a two-dimensional substitution is consistent or overlapping, and we provide practical algorithms to decide these properties in some particular cases."
2011-12-01 10:03:47+00:00,2011-12-01 10:03:47+00:00,"In a recent article, Behrens and Vingron (JCB 17, 12, 2010) compute waiting times for k-mers to appear during DNA evolution under the assumption that the considered k-mers do not occur in the initial DNA sequence, an issue arising when studying the evolution of regulatory DNA sequences with regard to transcription factor (TF) binding site emergence. The mathematical analysis underlying their computation assumes that occurrences of words under interest do not overlap. We relax here this assumption by use of an automata approach. In an alphabet of size 4 like the DNA alphabet, most words have no or a low autocorrelation; therefore, globally, our results confirm those of Behrens and Vingron. The outcome is quite different when considering highly autocorrelated k-mers; in this case, the autocorrelation pushes down the probability of occurrence of these k-mers at generation 1 and, consequently, increases the waiting time for apparition of these k-mers up to 40%. An analysis of existing TF binding sites unveils a significant proportion of k-mers exhibiting autocorrelation. Thus, our computations based on automata greatly improve the accuracy of predicting waiting times for the emergence of TF binding sites to appear during DNA evolution. We do the computation in the Bernoulli or M0 model; computations in the M1 model, a Markov model of order 1, are more costly in terms of time and memory but should produce similar results. While Behrens and Vingron considered specifically promoters of length 1000, we extend the results to promoters of any size; we exhibit the property that the probability that a k-mer occurs at generation time 1 while being absent at time 0 behaves linearly with respect to the length of the promoter, which induces a hyperbolic behaviour of the waiting time of any k-mer with respect to the length of the promoter."

This concept is intimately related to a classical topic in formal language theory, namely the star height of regular languages. We explore this connection, and obtain several new algorithmic insights regarding both cycle rank and star height. Among other results, we show that computing the cycle rank is NP-complete, even for sparse digraphs of maximum outdegree 2. Notwithstanding, we provide both a polynomial-time approximation algorithm and an exponential-time exact algorithm for this problem. The former algorithm yields an O((log n)^(3/2))- approximation in polynomial time, whereas the latter yields the optimum solution, and runs in time and space O*(1.9129^n) on digraphs of maximum outdegree at most two. Regarding the star height problem, we identify a subclass of the regular languages for which we can precisely determine the computational complexity of the star height problem. Namely, the star height problem for bideterministic languages is NP-complete, and this holds already for binary alphabets. Then we translate the algorithmic results concerning cycle rank to the bideterministic star height problem, thus giving a polynomial-time approximation as well as a reasonably fast exact exponential algorithm for bideterministic star height."

Formal grammars, typically in the form of BNF-like productions, describe the language syntax, which is then annotated for syntax-directed translation and completed with semantic actions. When, apart from the textual representation of data, an explicit representation of the corresponding data structure is required, the language designer has to devise the mapping between the suitable data model and its proper language specification, and then develop the conversion procedure from the parse tree to the data model instance. Unfortunately, whenever the format of the textual representation has to be modified, changes have to propagated throughout the entire language processor tool chain. These updates are time-consuming, tedious, and error-prone. Besides, in case different applications use the same language, several copies of the same language specification have to be maintained. In this paper, we introduce a model-based parser generator that decouples language specification from language processing, hence avoiding many of the problems caused by grammar-driven parsers and parser generators."

By applying recent results in the field of graded temporal logics, we present a new efficient model-checking algorithm for Hierarchical Finite State Machines (HSM), a well established symbolism long and widely used for representing hierarchical models of discrete systems. Performing model-checking against specifications expressed using graded temporal logics has the peculiarity of returning more counterexamples within a unique run. We think that this can greatly improve the efficacy of automatically getting test cases. In particular we verify two different models of HSM against branching time temporal properties."

Acting on infinite words, $\psi$ generates the class of standard episturmian words, including standard Arnoux-Rauzy words. In this paper we generalize the palindromization map, starting with a given code $X$ over $A$. The new map $\psi_X$ maps $X^*$ to the set $PAL$ of palindromes of $A^*$. In this way some properties of $\psi$ are lost and some are saved in a weak form. When $X$ has a finite deciphering delay one can extend $\psi_X$ to $X^{\omega}$, generating a class of infinite words much wider than standard episturmian words. For a finite and maximal code $X$ over $A$, we give a suitable generalization of standard Arnoux-Rauzy words, called $X$-AR words. We prove that any $X$-AR word is a morphic image of a standard Arnoux-Rauzy word and we determine some suitable linear lower and upper bounds to its factor complexity.   For any code $X$ we say that $\psi_X$ is conservative when $\psi_X(X^{*})\subseteq X^{*}$. We study conservative maps $\psi_X$ and conditions on $X$ assuring that $\psi_X$ is conservative. We also investigate the special case of morphic-conservative maps $\psi_{X}$, i.e., maps such that $\phi\circ \psi = \psi_X\circ \phi$ for an injective morphism $\phi$. Finally, we generalize $\psi_X$ by replacing palindromic closure with $\theta$-palindromic closure, where $\theta$ is any involutory antimorphism of $A^*$. This yields an extension of the class of $\theta$-standard words introduced by the authors in 2006."

In this paper, we propose a deterministic model for associating costs with strings that is parameterized by operations of interest (such as addition, scaling, and $\min$), a notion of {\em regularity} that provides a yardstick to measure expressiveness, and study decision problems and theoretical properties of resulting classes of cost functions. Our definition of regularity relies on the theory of string-to-tree transducers, and allows associating costs with events that are conditional upon regular properties of future events. Our model of {\em cost register automata} allows computation of regular functions using multiple ""write-only"" registers whose values can be combined using the allowed set of operations. We show that classical shortest-path algorithms as well as algorithms designed for computing {\em discounted costs}, can be adopted for solving the min-cost problems for the more general classes of functions specified in our model. Cost register automata with $\min$ and increment give a deterministic model that is equivalent to {\em weighted automata}, an extensively studied nondeterministic model, and this connection results in new insights and new open problems."

The main theorem states:   A subset of a family of recognisable sets is a lattice if and only if it is definable by a family of profinite equations.   This result extends Theorem 5.2 from [GGEP08] expressed only for finite words and morphisms to finite monoids. One of the applications of our theorem is the situation where objects are finite relational structures and recognisers are first order sentences. In that setting a simple characterisation of lattices of first order formulas arise.

Complementation of B\""uchi automata is a key step in program verification. Early constructions using a Ramsey-based argument have been supplanted by rank-based constructions with exponentially better bounds. In 2001 Lee et al. presented the size-change termination (SCT) problem, along with both a reduction to B\""uchi automata and a Ramsey-based algorithm. The Ramsey-based algorithm was presented as a more practical alternative to the automata-theoretic approach, but strongly resembles the initial complementation constructions for B\""uchi automata. We prove that the SCT algorithm is a specialized realization of the Ramsey-based complementation construction. To do so, we extend the Ramsey-based complementation construction to provide a containment-testing algorithm. Surprisingly, empirical analysis suggests that despite the massive gap in worst-case complexity, Ramsey-based approaches are superior over the domain of SCT problems. Upon further analysis we discover an interesting property of the problem space that both explains this result and provides a chance to improve rank-based tools. With these improvements, we show that theoretical gains in efficiency of the rank-based approach are mirrored in empirical performance."

The close relationship between the two has been well observed in the literature. In the case of nondeterministic finite automata on finite words (NFA), complementation and determinization have the same state complexity, namely Theta(2^n) where n is the state size. The same similarity between determinization and complementation was found for Buchi automata, where both operations were shown to have 2^\Theta(n lg n) state complexity. An intriguing question is whether there exists a type of omega-automata whose determinization is considerably harder than its complementation. In this paper, we show that for all common types of omega-automata, the determinization problem has the same state complexity as the corresponding complementation problem at the granularity of 2^\Theta(.)."

A standard solution to this problem involves computing a search tree whose nodes are abstractions of zones. These abstractions preserve underlying simulation relations on the state space of the automaton. For both effectiveness and efficiency reasons, they are parametrized by the maximal lower and upper bounds (LU-bounds) occurring in the guards of the automaton. We consider the aLU abstraction defined by Behrmann et al. Since this abstraction can potentially yield non-convex sets, it has not been used in implementations. We prove that aLU abstraction is the biggest abstraction with respect to LU-bounds that is sound and complete for reachability. We also provide an efficient technique to use the aLU abstraction to solve the reachability problem."

The standard solution to this problem involves computing the zone graph of the automaton, which in principle could be infinite. In order to make the graph finite, zones are approximated using an extrapolation operator. For reasons of efficiency in current algorithms extrapolation of a zone is always a zone and in particular it is convex.   In this paper, we propose to solve the reachability problem without such extrapolation operators. To ensure termination, we provide an efficient algorithm to check if a zone is included in the so called region closure of another. Although theoretically better, closure cannot be used in the standard algorithm since a closure of a zone may not be convex.   An additional benefit of the proposed approach is that it permits to calculate approximating parameters on-the-fly during exploration of the zone graph, as opposed to the current methods which do it by a static analysis of the automaton prior to the exploration. This allows for further improvements in the algorithm. Promising experimental results are presented."

The compression is represented by straight-line programs (SLPs), i.e. context-free grammars generating exactly one string. A novel technique of dealing with SLPs is introduced: the SLPs are recompressed, so that substrings of the input text are encoded in SLPs labelling the transitions of the NFA (DFA) in the same way, as in the SLP representing the input text. To this end, the SLPs are locally decompressed and then recompressed in a uniform way. Furthermore, such recompression induces only small changes in the automaton, in particular, the size of the automaton remains polynomial.   Using this technique it is shown that the compressed membership for NFA with compressed labels is in NP, thus confirming the conjecture of Plandowski and Rytter and extending the partial result of Lohrey and Mathissen; as it is already known, that this problem is NP-hard, we settle its exact computational complexity. Moreover, the same technique applied to the compressed membership for DFA with compressed labels yields that this problem is in P; for this problem, only trivial upper-bound PSPACE was known."

Existing techniques require an automata conversion and compaction step that prevents the use of existing automaton databases and hinders the maintenance of the resulting compact automata. In this paper, we propose Parallel Finite State Machines (PFSMs), which are able to run any DFA- or NFA-like state machines without a previous conversion or compaction step. PFSMs report, online, all the matches found within an input string and they solve the three aforementioned problems. Parallel Finite State Machines require quadratic time and linear memory and they are distributable.

Subsequently, the problem was attacked by restricting the power of 2DFAs (e.g., using a restricted input head movement) to the degree for which it was already possible to derive some exponential gaps between the weaker model and the standard 2NFAs. Here we use an opposite approach, increasing the power of 2DFAs to the degree for which it is still possible to obtain a subexponential conversion from the stronger model to the standard 2DFAs. In particular, it turns out that subexponential conversion is possible for two-way automata that make nondeterministic choices only when the input head scans one of the input tape endmarkers. However, there is no restriction on the input head movement. This implies that an exponential gap between 2NFAs and 2DFAs can be obtained only for unrestricted 2NFAs using capabilities beyond the proposed new model. As an additional bonus, conversion into a machine for the complement of the original language is polynomial in this model. The same holds for making such machines self-verifying, halting, or unambiguous. Finally, any superpolynomial lower bound for the simulation of such machines by standard 2DFAs would imply L<>NL. In the same way, the alternating version of these machines is related to L =? NL =? P, the classical computational complexity problems."

It is strictly less expressive than data automata and the expressive power is incomparable with register automata. The expressive power of weak data automata corresponds exactly to existential monadic second order logic with successor +1 and data value equality \sim, EMSO2(+1,\sim). It follows from previous work, David, et. al. in 2010, that the nonemptiness problem for weak data automata can be decided in 2-NEXPTIME.

Main advantages of biomolecular computers are massive parallel processing of data, expanded capacity of storing information and compatibility with living organisms (first attempts of using biomolecular computers in cancer therapy through blocking of improper genetic information are described in Benenson et al.(2004). However, biomolecular computers have several drawbacks including time-consuming procedures of preparing of input, problems in detecting output signals and interference with by-products. Due to these obstacles, there are few laboratory implementations of theoretically designed DNA computers (like the Turing machine and pushdown automaton), but there are many implementations of DNA computers for particular problems. The first practical laboratory implementation of the general theoretical model of a machine performing DNA-based calculations was a simple two-symbol two-state finite automaton established by Benenson et al.(2001). In the present work, we propose a new attitude, extending the capability of DNA-based finite automaton, by employing two or potentially more restriction enzymes instead of one used in other works.

The degree m of a CFG is one less than the maximum number of variable occurrences in the right hand side of any production. Given a CFG with n variables, we construct a Parikh-equivalent non-deterministic automaton whose number of states is upper bounded by a polynomial in $n (d^{2d(m+1)}), the degree of the polynomial being a small fixed constant. Our procedure is constructive and runs in time polynomial in the size of the automaton.

In this paper, we investigate functional weighted automata for four different measures: the sum, the mean, the discounted sum of weights along edges and the ratio between rewards and costs. On the positive side, we show that functionality is decidable for the four measures. Furthermore, the existential and universal threshold problems, the language inclusion problem and the equivalence problem are all decidable when the weighted automata are functional. On the negative side, we also study the quantitative extension of the realizability problem and show that it is undecidable for sum, mean and ratio. We finally show how to decide whether the language associated with a given functional automaton can be defined with a deterministic one, for sum, mean and discounted sum. The results on functionality and determinizability are expressed for the more general class of functional group automata. This allows one to formulate within the same framework new results related to discounted sum automata and known results on sum and mean automata. Ratio automata do not fit within this general scheme and different techniques are required to decide functionality."

The long standing best known upper bound for solving the problem is $\tilde{O}(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of vertices and $m$ is the number of edges in the graph. We are the first to break the $\tilde{O}(n\cdot m)$ bound by presenting a new technique that reduces the running time to $O(n^2)$. This bound also leads to an $O(n^2)$ algorithm time for computing the set of almost-sure winning vertices in alternating games with probabilistic transitions (improving an earlier bound of $\tilde{O}(n\cdot m)$) and in concurrent graph games with constant actions (improving an earlier bound of $O(n^3)$). We also show that the same technique can be used to compute the maximal end-component decomposition of a graph in time $O(n^2)$. Finally, we show how to maintain the winning set for B{\""u}chi objectives in alternating games under a sequence of edge insertions or a sequence of edge deletions in O(n) amortized time per operation. This is the first dynamic algorithm for this problem."

The syntactic complexity of a subclass of regular languages is the maximal syntactic complexity of languages in that subclass, taken as a function of the state complexity of these languages. We study the syntactic complexity of star-free regular languages, that is, languages that can be constructed from finite languages using union, complement and concatenation. We find tight upper bounds on the syntactic complexity of languages accepted by monotonic and partially monotonic automata. We introduce ""nearly monotonic"" automata, which accept star-free languages, and find a tight upper bound on the syntactic complexity of languages accepted by such automata. We conjecture that this bound is also an upper bound on the syntactic complexity of star-free languages."

A contract that has manually been rewritten in a structured English is automatically translated into a formal language using the Grammatical Framework (GF). In particular we use the contract language CL as a target formal language for this translation. In our framework CL specifications could then be input into the tool CLAN to detect the presence of conflicts (whether there are contradictory obligations, permissions, and prohibitions.

We present results on the decidability and precise complexity of the emptiness, universality and language containment problems for such machines, thus answering questions central to the use of these models in formal verification. Next, we characterize the languages recognized by PBAs topologically, demonstrating that though general PBAs can recognize languages that are not regular, topologically the languages are as simple as \omega-regular languages. Finally, we introduce Hierarchical PBAs, which are syntactically restricted forms of PBAs that are tractable and capture exactly the class of \omega-regular languages."

Over any finite alphabet with k >= 5 letters, Pansiot words avoiding 3-repetitions form a regular language, which is a rather small superset of the set of all threshold words. Using cylindric and 2-dimensional words, we prove that, as k approaches infinity, the growth rates of complexity for these regular languages tend to the growth rate of complexity of some ternary 2-dimensional language. The numerical estimate of this growth rate is about 1.2421."

We distinguish trapezoidal words into two disjoint subsets: open and closed trapezoidal words. A trapezoidal word is closed if its longest repeated prefix has exactly two occurrences in the word, the second one being a suffix of the word. Otherwise it is open. We show that open trapezoidal words are all primitive and that closed trapezoidal words are all Sturmian. We then show that trapezoidal palindromes are closed (and therefore Sturmian). This allows us to characterize the special factors of Sturmian palindromes. We end with several open problems."

Medvedev) states that every language recognized by a finite automaton is the homomorphic image of a local language, over a much larger so-called local alphabet, namely the alphabet of the edges of the transition graph. Local languages are characterized by the value k=2 of the sliding window width in the McNaughton and Papert's infinite hierarchy of strictly locally testable languages (k-slt). We generalize Medvedev's result in a new direction, studying the relationship between the width and the alphabetic ratio telling how much larger the local alphabet is. We prove that every regular language is the image of a k-slt language on an alphabet of doubled size, where the width logarithmically depends on the automaton size, and we exhibit regular languages for which any smaller alphabetic ratio is insufficient. More generally, we express the trade-off between alphabetic ratio and width as a mathematical relation derived from a careful encoding of the states. At last we mention some directions for theoretical development and application."

A natural question is how we can extend the notion of maximality to codes that are not UD. In this paper we give an answer to this question. To do this we introduce a partial order in the set of submonoids of a monoid showing the existence, in this poset, of maximal elements that we call full monoids. Then a set of generators of a full monoid is, by definition, a maximal code. We show how this definition extends, in a natural way, the existing definition concerning UD codes and we find a characteristic property of a monoid generated by a maximal UD code."

The repetitive threshold r(a) of an a-letter alphabet is the smallest rational number for which there exists an infinite word whose finite factors have exponent at most r(a). This notion was introduced in 1972 by Dejean who gave the exact values of r(a) for every alphabet size a as it has been eventually proved in 2009.   The finite-repetition threshold for an a-letter alphabet refines the above notion. It is the smallest rational number FRt(a) for which there exists an infinite word whose finite factors have exponent at most FRt(a) and that contains a finite number of factors with exponent r(a). It is known from Shallit (2008) that FRt(2)=7/3.   With each finite-repetition threshold is associated the smallest number of r(a)-exponent factors that can be found in the corresponding infinite word. It has been proved by Badkobeh and Crochemore (2010) that this number is 12 for infinite binary words whose maximal exponent is 7/3.   We show that FRt(3)=r(3)=7/4 and that the bound is achieved with an infinite word containing only two 7/4-exponent words, the smallest number.   Based on deep experiments we conjecture that FRt(4)=r(4)=7/5. The question remains open for alphabets with more than four letters.

I am going to tell about periodicity of permutations, their complexity according to several definitions and their automatic properties, that is, about usual parameters of words, now extended to permutations and behaving sometimes similarly to those for words, sometimes not.

Motivated on the one hand by the well-known theory of Sturmian words which model conveniently discrete lines in the plane, and on the other hand by the development of digital geometry, this study reveals strong links between the two fields. Discrete figures are identified with polyominoes encoded by words. The combinatorial tools lead to elegant descriptions of geometrical features and efficient algorithms. Among these, radix-trees are useful for efficiently detecting path intersection, Lyndon and Christoffel words appear as the main tools for describing digital convexity; equations on words allow to better understand tilings by translations."

Inspired by ideas from robust control and dissipative systems theory, we present a formal definition of robustness and algorithmic tools for the design of optimally robust controllers for omega-regular properties on discrete transition systems. Formally, we define metric automata - automata equipped with a metric on states - and strategies on metric automata which guarantee robustness for omega-regular properties. We present fixed point algorithms to construct optimally robust strategies in polynomial time. In contrast to strategies computed by classical graph theoretic approaches, the strategies computed by our algorithm ensure that the behaviours of the controlled system gracefully degrade under the action of disturbances; the degree of degradation is parameterized by the magnitude of the disturbance. We show an application of our theory to the design of controllers that tolerate infinitely many transient errors provided they occur infrequently enough."

Indeed, almost every phenomenon in nature exhibits a multiscale behaviour, i.e., it is the outcome of interactions that occur at different spatial and temporal scales. Although several ways to provide ""multilayer"" models have been proposed, only Complex Automata naturally embed spatial information and realize the multiscale approach with well-established inter-scale integration schemas. Recently, such approach has been restated in terms of Spatial P systems - a variant of P systems with a more geometric concept of space.   In this work we discuss how mobile membranes, a variant of membrane systems inspired by the biological movements of endocytosis and exocytosis, can be efficaciously exploited to define a uniform multiscale coupling scheme relying only on the features of the formalism itself."
2011-08-17 09:26:59+00:00,2011-08-17 09:26:59+00:00,Multi-valued networks provide a simple yet expressive qualitative state based modelling approach for biological systems. In this paper we develop an abstraction theory for asynchronous multi-valued network models that allows the state space of a model to be reduced while preserving key properties of the model. The abstraction theory therefore provides a mechanism for coping with the state space explosion problem and supports the analysis and comparison of multi-valued networks. We take as our starting point the abstraction theory for synchronous multi-valued networks which is based on the finite set of traces that represent the behaviour of such a model. The problem with extending this approach to the asynchronous case is that we can now have an infinite set of traces associated with a model making a simple trace inclusion test infeasible. To address this we develop a decision procedure for checking asynchronous abstractions based on using the finite state graph of an asynchronous multi-valued network to reason about its trace semantics. We illustrate the abstraction techniques developed by considering a detailed case study based on a multi-valued network model of the regulation of tryptophan biosynthesis in Escherichia coli.

We show that PP can be seen as a particular variant of GCPS. We also consider a particular stochastic evolution satisfying the fairness condition and obtain that it corresponds to the run of a Gillespie's SSA. This permits to further describe the dynamics of GCPS by a system of ODEs when the population size goes to the infinity.

Finite characterizations of the defined preorders and relations led to the possibility of verification by comparing an implementation with a specification in a setting where systems were seen as black boxes with input and output capabilities, thus neglecting internal undetectable behaviours.   In this paper, we start defining a porting of the well-established testing theory into membrane computing, in order to investigate possible benefits in terms of inherited analysis/verification techniques and interesting biological applications. P Algebra, a process algebra for describing P Systems, is used as a natural candidate for the porting since it enjoys the desirable property of being compositional and comes with other observational equivalences already defined and studied."

2011-08-14 12:14:22+00:00,2011-08-14 12:14:22+00:00,"We prove that some fairly basic questions on automata reading infinite words depend on the models of the axiomatic system ZFC. It is known that there are only three possibilities for the cardinality of the complement of an omega-language $L(A)$ accepted by a B\""uchi 1-counter automaton $A$. We prove the following surprising result: there exists a 1-counter B\""uchi automaton $A$ such that the cardinality of the complement $L(A)^-$ of the omega-language $L(A)$ is not determined by ZFC: (1). There is a model $V_1$ of ZFC in which $L(A)^-$ is countable. (2). There is a model $V_2$ of ZFC in which $L(A)^-$ has cardinal $2^{\aleph_0}$. (3). There is a model $V_3$ of ZFC in which $L(A)^-$ has cardinal $\aleph_1$ with $\aleph_0<\aleph_1<2^{\aleph_0}$. We prove a very similar result for the complement of an infinitary rational relation accepted by a 2-tape B\""uchi automaton $B$. As a corollary, this proves that the Continuum Hypothesis may be not satisfied for complements of 1-counter omega-languages and for complements of infinitary rational relations accepted by 2-tape B\""uchi automata. We infer from the proof of the above results that basic decision problems about 1-counter omega-languages or infinitary rational relations are actually located at the third level of the analytical hierarchy. In particular, the problem to determine whether the complement of a 1-counter omega-language (respectively, infinitary rational relation) is countable is in $\Sigma_3^1 \setminus (\Pi_2^1 \cup \Sigma_2^1)$. This is rather surprising if compared to the fact that it is decidable whether an infinitary rational relation is countable (respectively, uncountable)."

In most cases, we are able to show that the lower bounds for one-way machines remain tight in the real-time case. Memory lower bounds for nonregular acceptance on other devices are also addressed. It is shown that increasing the number of stacks of real-time pushdown automata can result in exponential improvement in the total amount of space usage for nonregular language recognition."

In this paper we investigate the hairpin completion of regular languages.   It is well known that hairpin completions of regular languages are linear context-free and not necessarily regular. As regularity of a (linear) context-free language is not decidable, the question arose whether regularity of a hairpin completion of regular languages is decidable. We prove that this problem is decidable and we provide a polynomial time algorithm.   Furthermore, we prove that the hairpin completion of regular languages is an unambiguous linear context-free language and, as such, it has an effectively computable growth function. Moreover, we show that the growth of the hairpin completion is exponential if and only if the growth of the underlying languages is exponential and, in case the hairpin completion is regular, then the hairpin completion and the underlying languages have the same growth indicator."

In discrete event systems theory, two concurrent systems are said to be in conflict if they can get trapped in a situation where they are both waiting or running endlessly, forever unable to complete their common task. The conflict preorder is a process-algebraic pre-congruence that compares two processes based on their possible conflicts in combination with other processes. This paper improves on previous theoretical descriptions of the conflict preorder by introducing less conflicting pairs as a concrete state-based characterisation. Based on this characterisation, an effective algorithm is presented to determine whether two processes are related according to the conflict preorder."

Like the usual automatic groups graph automatic ones enjoy many nice properties: these group are invariant under the change of generators, they are closed under direct and free products, certain types of amalgamated products, and finite extensions. Furthermore, the Word Problem in graph automatic groups is decidable in quadratic time. However, the class of graph automatic groups is much wider then the class of automatic groups. For example, we prove that all finitely generated 2-nilpotent groups and Baumslag-Solitar groups B(1,n) are graph automatic, as well as many other metabelian groups."

We unify and generalize several decidability results for probabilistic automata over infinite words, and identify a robust (closed under union and intersection) subclass of probabilistic automata for which all the qualitative decision problems are decidable for parity conditions. We also show that if the input words are restricted to lasso shape (regular) words, then the positive and almost problems are decidable for all probabilistic automata with parity conditions.

When epsilon is zero we retrieve the usual notions of bisimulation and simulation on PAs. We give logical characterisations of these notions by choosing suitable logics which differ from the elementary ones, L with negation and L without negation, by the modal operator. Using flow networks, we show how to compute the relations in PTIME. This allows the definition of an efficiently computable non-discounted distance between the states of a PA. A natural modification of this distance is introduced, to obtain a discounted distance, which weakens the influence of long term transitions. We compare our notions of distance to others previously defined and illustrate our approach on various examples. We also show that our distance is not expansive with respect to process algebra operators. Although L without negation is a suitable logic to characterise epsilon-(bi)simulation on deterministic PAs, it is not for general PAs; interestingly, we prove that it does characterise weaker notions, called a priori epsilon-(bi)simulation, which we prove to be NP-difficult to decide."

Such languages are regular, and we show that they naturally arise in several applications such as querying graph databases and program analysis. As the main contribution of the paper, we provide a complete characterization of the complexity of the main computational problems related to such languages: nonemptiness, universality, containment, membership, as well as the problem of constructing NFAs capturing such languages. We also look at the extension when domains of variables could be arbitrary regular languages, and show that under the certainty semantics, languages remain regular and the complexity of the main computational problems does not change."

We show that only two more structural operations, namely, reverse abstraction and reverse super-structuring (the duals of abstraction and super-structuring respectively) suffice in order to exploit the full power of Turing-equivalent generative grammars in induction. We explore the implications of this theorem with respect to the nature of hidden variables, radical positivism and the 2-century old claim of David Hume about the principles of connexion among ideas."

Even when the underlying mechanisms are understood, or at least measurable, the presence of dissipation and irreversibility in biological, computational and social systems makes the problem harder. Here we demonstrate the construction of effective theories in the presence of both irreversibility and noise, in a dynamical model with underlying feedback. We use the Krohn-Rhodes theorem to show how the composition of underlying mechanisms can lead to innovations in the emergent effective theory. We show how dissipation and irreversibility fundamentally limit the lifetimes of these emergent structures, even though, on short timescales, the group properties may be enriched compared to their noiseless counterparts."

The proposed products are explicit graphs of aggregates (symbolic sets of states) that can be interpreted as B\""uchi automata. These hybrid approaches allow on the one hand to use classical emptiness-check algorithms and build the graph on-the-fly, and on the other hand, to have a compact encoding of the state space thanks to the symbolic representation of the aggregates. The Symbolic Observation Product assumes a globally stuttering property (e.g., LTL \ X) to aggregate states. The Self-Loop Aggregation Product} does not require the property to be globally stuttering (i.e., it can tackle full LTL), but dynamically detects and exploits a form of stuttering where possible. Our experiments show that these two variants, while incomparable with each other, can outperform other existing approaches."

For this reason the problem of identifying and reacting to faults has received a large attention in the control and computer science communities. In this paper we study the fault diagnosis problem for hybrid systems from a game-theoretical point of view. A hybrid system is a system mixing continuous and discrete behaviours that cannot be faithfully modeled neither by using a formalism with continuous dynamics only nor by a formalism including only discrete dynamics. We use the well known framework of hybrid automata for modeling hybrid systems, and we define a Fault Diagnosis Game on them, using two players: the environment and the diagnoser. The environment controls the evolution of the system and chooses whether and when a fault occurs. The diagnoser observes the external behaviour of the system and announces whether a fault has occurred or not. Existence of a winning strategy for the diagnoser implies that faults can be detected correctly, while computing such a winning strategy corresponds to implement a diagnoser for the system. We will show how to determine the existence of a winning strategy, and how to compute it, for some decidable classes of hybrid automata like o-minimal hybrid automata."

We show that reactive safety is a strictly larger class of properties than standard safety.

In this paper, a decidable model called class automata with priority class condition, which restricts class automata but strictly extends data automata, is proposed. The decidability of this model is obtained by establishing a correspondence with priority multicounter automata.

Multiple interactions of finite state machines in complex systems are well captured by the notion of non-flat systems. Non--flat systems are ""finite state machines"" where each ""state"" can be either a basic state or an aggregate of finite state machines. By expanding a non-flat system, a flat system is obtained which is an ordinary finite state machine. In this paper we introduce a novel class of non--flat systems called Arena of Finite State Machines (AFSM). AFSMs are collections of finite state machines that interact concurrently through a communication network. We propose a notion of compositional bisimulation that allows checking bisimulation equivalence of AFSMs by directly exploiting their communication networks and hence, without the need of expanding the AFSMs to finite state machines. Compositional bisimulation allows a computational complexity reduction when checking bisimulation equivalence of AFSMs, as formally quantified in the paper. An application of the proposed framework to the regulation of gene expression in the bacterium Escherichia coli is also presented."

In particular, they have shown that a fuzzy language over an integral lattice-ordered monoid can be represented by a fuzzy regular expression if and only if it can be recognized by a fuzzy finite automaton. However, they did not give any effective method for constructing an equivalent fuzzy finite automaton from a given fuzzy regular expression. In this paper we provide such an effective method. Transforming scalars appearing in a fuzzy regular expression {\alpha} into letters of the new extended alphabet, we convert the fuzzy regular expression {\alpha} to an ordinary regular expression {\alpha}_{R}. Then, starting from an arbitrary nondeterministic finite automaton A that recognizes the language ||{\alpha}_R|| represented by the regular expression {\alpha}_R, we construct fuzzy finite automata A_{\alpha} and A_{\alpha}^r with the same or even less number of states than the automaton A, which recognize the fuzzy language ||{\alpha}|| represented by the fuzzy regular expression {\alpha}. The starting nondeterministic finite automaton A can be obtained from {\alpha}_R using any of the well-known constructions for converting regular expressions to nondeterministic finite automata, such as Glushkov-McNaughton-Yamada's position automaton, Brzozowski's derivative automaton, Antimirov's partial derivative automaton, or Ilie-Yu's follow automaton."

In this paper we consider regular realizability problems for languages consist- ing of all prefixes of an infinite word. These problems are related to the automata on infinite words and to the decidability of monadic second-order theories. The main contribution is a new decidability condition for regular realizability problems and for monadic-second order theories. We also show that decidability of a regular realizability problem is equivalent to decidability of some prefix realizability problem.

Our contribution to solve this long-standing problem which relates, for instance, to the reachability analysis of recursive programs over unbounded data domain, is to identify a class of CFLs called the finite-index CFLs for which the problem is decidable. The k-index approximation of a CFL can be obtained by discarding all the words that cannot be derived within a budget k on the number of occurrences of non-terminals. A finite-index CFL is thus a CFL which coincides with its k-index approximation for some k. We decide whether the intersection of a finite-index CFL and a PNL is empty by reducing it to the reachability problem of Petri nets with weak inhibitor arcs, a class of systems with infinitely many states for which reachability is known to be decidable. Conversely, we show that the reachability problem for a Petri net with weak inhibitor arcs reduces to the emptiness problem of a finite-index CFL intersected with a PNL."

The series includes: the morphological analysis of Semitic languages, the preservation of intermediate results in transducer cascades, the induction of morphological rules from corpora, the alignment of lexicon entries, the automatic extraction of acronyms and their meaning from corpora, and the search for cognates in a bilingual lexicon.   All described operations and applications have been implemented with Xerox's WFSC tool."
2011-04-26 15:48:59+00:00,2011-04-26 15:48:59+00:00,In this paper we describe an approach to finding the shortest reset word of a finite synchronizing automaton by using a SAT solver. We use this approach to perform an experimental study of the length of the shortest reset word of a finite synchronizing automaton. The largest automata we considered had 100 states. The results of the experiments allow us to formulate a hypothesis that the length of the shortest reset word of a random finite automaton with $n$ states and 2 input letters with high probability is sublinear with respect to $n$ and can be estimated as $1.95 n^{0.55}.$

We first define the free clone T(L, C) of terms of a first order language L over a set C of parameters in a standard way. The free right algebra F(L, C) of formulas over T(L, C) is then generated by atomic formulas. Structures for L over C are represented as perfect valuations of F(L, C), and theories of L are represented as filters of F(L). Finally Godel's completeness theorem and first incompleteness theorem are stated as expected."

With this survey article we give an overview about relevant research to this topic during the last twenty years including own investigations and some new results. In Section 1 after recalling the most important notions from formal language theory we illustrate the connection between coding theory and primitive words by some facts. We define primitive words as words having only a trivial representation as the power of another word. Nonprimitive words (without the empty word) are exactly the periodic words. Every nonempty word is a power of an uniquely determined primitive word which is called the root of the former one. The set of all roots of nonempty words of a language is called the root of the language. The primitive words have interesting combinatorial properties which we consider in Section 2. In Section 3 we investigate the relationship between the set $Q$ of all primitive words over some fixed alphabet and the language classes of the Chomsky Hierarchy and the contextual languages over the same alphabet. The computational complexity of the set $Q$ and of the roots of languages are considered in Section 4. The set of all powers of the same degree of all words from a language is the power of this language. We examine the powers of languages for different sets of exponents, and especially their regularity and context-freeness, in Section 5, and the decidability of appropriate questions in Section 6. Section 7 is dedicated to several generalizations of the notions of periodicity and primitivity of words."

Although many approaches address BPC, they mostly assume the existence of some kind of unified base of process constraints and focus on their verification over the business processes. However, it remains unclear how such an inte- grated process constraint base can be built up, even though this con- stitutes the essential prerequisite for all further compliance checks. In addition, the heterogeneity of process constraints has been neglected so far. Without identification and separation of process constraints from domain rules as well as unification of process constraints, the success- ful IT support of BPC will not be possible. In this technical report we introduce a unified representation framework that enables the identifica- tion of process constraints from domain rules and their later unification within a process constraint base. Separating process constraints from domain rules can lead to significant reduction of compliance checking effort. Unification enables consistency checks and optimizations as well as maintenance and evolution of the constraint base on the other side."

This problem was proved undecidable recently. We sharpen this result, showing that the undecidability result holds even if the probabilistic automata have only one probabilistic transition. Our main contribution is to introduce a new class of probabilistic automata, called leaktight automata, for which the value 1 problem is shown decidable (and PSPACE-complete). We construct an algorithm based on the computation of a monoid abstracting the behaviours of the automaton, and rely on algebraic techniques developed by Simon for the correctness proof. The class of leaktight automata is decidable in PSPACE, subsumes all subclasses of probabilistic automata whose value 1 problem is known to be decidable (in particular deterministic automata), and is closed under two natural composition operators."

We introduce streaming tree transducers as an analyzable, executable, and expressive model for transforming unranked ordered trees in a single pass. Given a linear encoding of the input tree, the transducer makes a single left-to-right pass through the input, and computes the output in linear time using a finite-state control, a visibly pushdown stack, and a finite number of variables that store output chunks that can be combined using the operations of string-concatenation and tree-insertion. We prove that the expressiveness of the model coincides with transductions definable using monadic second-order logic (MSO). Existing models of tree transducers either cannot implement all MSO-definable transformations, or require regular look ahead that prohibits single-pass implementation. We show a variety of analysis problems such as type-checking and checking functional equivalence are solvable for our model."

In this paper, we focus on the problem of finding conditions under which the iterated hairpin completion of a given word is regular. According to the numbers of words $\alpha$ and $\calpha$ that initiate hairpin completion and how they are scattered, we classify the set of all words $w$. For some basic classes of words $w$ containing small numbers of occurrences of $\alpha$ and $\calpha$, we prove that the iterated hairpin completion of $w$ is regular. For other classes with higher numbers of occurrences of $\alpha$ and $\calpha$, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the iterated hairpin completion of a word in these classes to be regular."

GPUs, because of their architectural optimization for parallel computations, are well-suited for highly parallelizable problems. Due to the advent of general purpose GPU computing in recent years, GPUs are not limited to graphics and video processing alone, but include computationally intensive scientific and mathematical applications as well. Moreover P systems, including SNP systems, are inherently and maximally parallel computing models whose inspirations are taken from the functioning and dynamics of a living cell. In particular, SNP systems try to give a modest but formal representation of a special type of cell known as the neuron and their interactions with one another. The nature of SNP systems allowed their representation as matrices, which is a crucial step in simulating them on highly parallel devices such as GPUs. The highly parallel nature of SNP systems necessitate the use of hardware intended for parallel computations. The simulation algorithms, design considerations, and implementation are presented. Finally, simulation results, observations, and analyses using an SNP system that generates all numbers in $\mathbb N$ - {1} are discussed, as well as recommendations for future work."

We conclude from these results that the parallel composition of (communicating) RTMs can be simulated by a single RTM. We prove that there exist universal RTMs modulo branching bisimilarity, but these essentially employ divergence to be able to simulate an RTM of arbitrary branching degree.

Here we use the conjunction of these two concepts as a powerful tool in the study of equivalence between fuzzy automata. We prove that a uniform fuzzy relation between fuzzy automata $\cal A$ and $\cal B$ is a forward bisimulation if and only if its kernel and co-kernel are forward bisimulation fuzzy equivalences on $\cal A$ and $\cal B$ and there is a special isomorphism between factor fuzzy automata with respect to these fuzzy equivalences. As a consequence we get that fuzzy automata $\cal A$ and $\cal B$ are UFB-equivalent, i.e., there is a uniform forward bisimulation between them, if and only if there is a special isomorphism between the factor fuzzy automata of $\cal A$ and $\cal B$ with respect to their greatest forward bisimulation fuzzy equivalences. This result reduces the problem of testing UFB-equivalence to the problem of testing isomorphism of fuzzy automata, which is closely related to the well-known graph isomorphism problem. We prove some similar results for backward-forward bisimulations, and we point to fundamental differences. Because of the duality with the studied concepts, backward and forward-backward bisimulations are not considered separately. Finally, we give a comprehensive overview of various concepts on deterministic, nondeterministic, fuzzy, and weighted automata, which are related to bisimulations."

Generally, fuzzy quasi-orders and fuzzy equivalences are equally good in the state reduction, but we show that right and left invariant fuzzy quasi-orders give better reductions than right and left invariant fuzzy equivalences. We also show that alternate reductions by means of fuzzy quasi-orders give better results than alternate reductions by means of fuzzy equivalences. Furthermore we study a more general type of fuzzy quasi-orders, weakly right and left invariant ones, and we show that they are closely related to determinization of fuzzy recognizers.

In this symbiosis, uniform relations serve as equivalence relations which relate states of two possibly different nondeterministic automata, and bisimulations ensure compatibility with the transitions, initial and terminal states of these automata. We define six types of bisimulations, but due to the duality we discuss three of them: forward, backward-forward, and weak forward bisimulations. For each od these three types of bisimulations we provide a procedure which decides whether there is a bisimulation of this type between two automata, and when it exists, the same procedure computes the greatest one. We also show that there is a uniform forward bisimulation between two automata if and only if the factor automata with respect to the greatest forward bisimulation equivalences on these automata are isomorphic. We prove a similar theorem for weak forward bisimulations, using the concept of a weak forward isomorphism instead of an isomorphism.

We show that each of these models is expressively complete for regular Boolean combination of right ideals. Right ideals over finite words resemble the open sets in the Cantor topology over infinite words. An omega-regular language is a Boolean combination of open sets if and only if it is recognizable by a deterministic Staiger-Wagner automaton; and our result can be seen as a finitary version of this classical theorem. In addition, we also consider the canonical automaton models for right ideals, prefix-closed languages, and factorial languages.   In the last section, we consider a two-way automaton model which is known to be expressively complete for two-variable first-order logic.

We describe methods of constructing the \'atomaton, and prove that it is isomorphic to the reverse automaton of the minimal deterministic finite automaton (DFA) of the reverse language. We study ""atomic"" NFAs in which the right language of every state is a union of atoms. We generalize Brzozowski's double-reversal method for minimizing a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), showing that the result of applying the subset construction to an NFA is a minimal DFA if and only if the reverse of the NFA is atomic. We prove that Sengoku's claim that his method always finds a minimal NFA is false."

As a consequence it follows that many related sequences are either k-automatic or k-regular. These include many sequences previously studied in the literature, such as the recurrence function, the appearance function, and the repetitivity index. We also give some new characterizations of the class of k-regular sequences. Many results extend to other sequences defined in terms of Pisot numeration systems."

Another variant called hairpin lengthening has been recently introduced and studied on the closure properties and algorithmic problems concerning several families of languages. In this paper, we introduce a new operation of this kind, called hairpin incompletion which is not only an extension of bounded hairpin completion, but also a restricted (bounded) variant of hairpin lengthening. Further, the hairpin incompletion operation provides a formal language theoretic framework that models a bio-molecular technique nowadays known as Whiplash PCR. We study the closure properties of language families under both the operation and its iterated version. We show that a family of languages closed under intersection with regular sets, concatenation with regular sets, and finite union is closed under one-sided iterated hairpin incompletion, and that a family of languages containing all linear languages and closed under circular permutation, left derivative and substitution is also closed under iterated hairpin incompletion."

Also, we show that computing fixed-word simulation is PSPACE-complete. On the practical side, we introduce proxy simulations, which are novel polynomial-time computable preorders sound for quotienting. In particular, delayed proxy simulation induce quotients that can be smaller by an arbitrarily large factor than direct backward simulation. We derive proxy simulations as the product of a theory of refinement transformers: A refinement transformer maps preorders non-decreasingly, preserving certain properties. We study under which general conditions refinement transformers are sound for quotienting."

In arXiv:1102.2960 we showed a construction for complementing Streett automata with the upper bound $2^{O(n \lg n+nk \lg k)}$ for $k = O(n)$ and $2^{O(n^{2} \lg n)}$ for $k=\omega(n)$. In this paper we establish a matching lower bound $2^{\Omega(n \lg n+nk \lg k)}$ for $k = O(n)$ and $2^{\Omega(n^{2} \lg n)}$ for $k = \omega(n)$, and therefore showing that the construction is asymptotically optimal with respect to the $2^{\Theta(\cdot)}$ notation."

Determining the complexity of Streett complementation has been an open question since the late '80s. In this paper show a complementation construction with upper bound $2^{O(n \lg n+nk \lg k)}$ for $k = O(n)$ and $2^{O(n^{2} \lg n)}$ for $k = \omega(n)$, which matches well the lower bound obtained in \cite{CZ11a}.

In case the input automata are acyclic NFAs (acyclic DFAs), the corresponding trees are (succinctly represented) finite trees, and the isomorphism problem turns out to be PSPACE-complete (resp. P-complete). A linear order is regular if it is isomorphic to the lexicographic order on a regular language.

One symbol is used to capture redundancy of individual input variables, and another to capture permutability in sets of input variables: fully characterizing the canalization present in Boolean functions. Two-symbol schemata explain aspects of the behaviour of automata networks that the characterization of their emergent patterns does not capture. We use our method to compare two well-known cellular automata for the density classification task: the human engineered CA GKL, and another obtained via genetic programming (GP). We show that despite having very different collective behaviour, these rules are very similar. Indeed, GKL is a special case of GP. Therefore, we demonstrate that it is more feasible to compare cellular automata via schema redescriptions of their rules, than by looking at their emergent behaviour, leading us to question the tendency in complexity research to pay much more attention to emergent patterns than to local interactions."

Gandy formulates postulates about physics, such as homogeneity of space and time, bounded density and velocity of information --- and proves that the physical Church-Turing thesis is a consequence of these postulates.

We thus obtain an infinite automaton for representing the set of C\infinity-words. We derive a classification of C\infinity-words induced by the structure of the automaton. Then, we introduce a new framework for dealing with \infinity-words, based on a three letter alphabet. This allows us to define a compacted version of the automaton, that we use to prove that every C\infinity-word admits a repetition in C\infinity whose length is polynomially bounded."

In 2009 this decidability problem has been solved positively by providing a polynomial time algorithm. In this paper we improve the complexity bound by showing that the decision problem is actually NL-complete. This complexity bound holds for both, the one-sided and the two-sided hairpin completions."

It has natural interpretations. In particular, it captures communicating automata with an unbounded number of processes, whose semantics can be described as a set of (dynamic) message sequence charts. On the specification side, we provide a local existential monadic second-order logic that does not impose any restriction on the number of variables.

We show that DTA measures over semi-Markov processes are well-defined with probability one, and there are only finitely many values that can be assumed by these measures with positive probability. We also give an algorithm which approximates these values and the associated probabilities up to an arbitrarily small given precision. Thus, we obtain a general and effective framework for analysing DTA measures over semi-Markov processes."

Knast (1983) has shown that it is decidable whether a language has dot-depth one. We extend Knast's result to infinite words. In particular, we describe the class of languages definable in alternation-free first-order logic over infinite words, and we give an effective characterization of this fragment. This characterization has two components. The first component is identical to Knast's algebraic property for finite words and the second component is a topological property, namely being a Boolean combination of Cantor sets.   As an intermediate step we consider finite and infinite words simultaneously. We then obtain the results for infinite words as well as for finite words as special cases.

Given a non-deterministic automaton with $n$ states, our construction gives a DPW with at most $2^{O(n^2 \log n)}$ states and $O(n^2)$ parity indices. The corresponding bounds when the original automaton is deterministic are O(n!) and O(n), respectively. Our algorithm gives better asymptotic bounds on the number of states and parity indices vis-a-vis the best known technique when determinizing Rabin or Streett automata with $\Omega{(2^n)}$ acceptance pairs, where $n > 1$. We demonstrate this by describing a family of Streett (and Rabin) automata with $2^{n}$ non-redundant acceptance pairs, for which the best known determinization technique gives a DPW with at least $\Omega{(2^{(n^3)})}$ states, while our construction constructs a DRW/DPW with $2^{O(n^2\log n)}$ states. An easy corollary of our construction is that an $\omega$-language with Rabin index $k$ cannot be recognized by any $\omega$-automaton (deterministic or non-deterministic) with fewer than $O(\sqrt{k})$ states."

We provide a doubly exponential procedure to compute from any LTL formula with Until, Since, and the Stavi connectives an automaton that decides whether that formula holds on the input word.

It requires that there exists an unknown, fixed bound b such that something good happens within b transitions. In this work we consider automata with finitary acceptance conditions defined by finitary Buchi, parity and Streett languages. We study languages expressible by such automata: we give their topological complexity and present a regular-expression characterization. We compare the expressive power of finitary automata and give optimal algorithms for classical decisions questions. We show that the finitary languages are Sigma 2-complete; we present a complete picture of the expressive power of various classes of automata with finitary and infinitary acceptance conditions; we show that the languages defined by finitary parity automata exactly characterize the star-free fragment of omega B-regular languages; and we show that emptiness is NLOGSPACE-complete and universality as well as language inclusion are PSPACE-complete for finitary parity and Streett automata."

To this end we introduce the factor topology over infinite words. It turns out that a language L is in the intersection of FO2 and Sigma2 if and only if L is the interior of an FO2 language. Symmetrically, a language is in the intersection of FO2 and Pi2 if and only if it is the topological closure of an FO2 language. The fragment Delta2, which by definition is the intersection of Sigma2 and Pi2 contains exactly the clopen languages in FO2. In particular, over infinite words Delta2 is a strict subclass of FO2. Our characterizations yield decidability of the membership problem for all these fragments over finite and infinite words; and as a corollary we also obtain decidability for infinite words.

Using countable automata associated with (-{\beta})-expansions, we characterize the case where the (-{\beta})-shift is a system of finite type. We prove that, if {\beta} is a Pisot number, then the (-{\beta})-shift is a sofic system. In that case, addition (and more generally normalization on any alphabet) is realizable by a finite transducer. We then give an on-line algorithm for the conversion from positive base {\beta} to negative base -{\beta}. When {\beta} is a Pisot number, the conversion can be realized by a finite on-line transducer."

To this end, we introduce probabilistic split-join systems (pSJSs), a model for parallel programs, generalising both probabilistic pushdown systems (a model for sequential probabilistic procedural programs which is equivalent to recursive Markov chains) and stochastic branching processes (a classical mathematical model with applications in various areas such as biology, physics, and language processing). Our pSJS model allows for a possibly recursive spawning of parallel processes; the spawned processes can synchronise and return values. We study the basic performance measures of pSJSs, especially the distribution and expectation of space, work and time. Our results extend and improve previously known results on the subsumed models. We also show how to do performance analysis in practice, and present two case studies illustrating the modelling power of pSJSs."

Indeed, Stallings' construction, associating a finite inverse automaton with every such subgroup, inaugurated a complete rewriting of free group algorithmics, with connections to other fields such as topology or dynamics.   Another important vector in the chapter is the fundamental Benois' Theorem, characterizing rational subsets of free groups. The theorem and its consequences really explain why language theory can be successfully applied to the study of free groups. Rational subsets of (free) groups can play a major role in proving statements (a priori unrelated to the notion of rationality) by induction. The chapter also includes related results for more general classes of groups, such as virtually free groups or graph groups."

The two main lines of research have as their most representative objects the class of automatic groups (including word-hyperbolic groups as a particular case) and automata groups (singled out among the more general self-similar groups).   The first approach implements in the language of automata some tight constraints on the geometry of the group's Cayley graph, building strange, beautiful bridges between far-off domains. Automata are used to define a normal form for group elements, and to monitor the fundamental group operations.   The second approach features groups acting in a finitely constrained manner on a regular rooted tree. Automata define sequential permutations of the tree, and represent the group elements themselves. The choice of particular classes of automata has often provided groups with exotic behaviour which have revolutioned our perception of infinite finitely generated groups."

Second, it allows us to derive upper bounds on the block neighborhood: for a single CA as function of the classical and inverse neighborhoods, and for the composition of several CAs. One consequence of that is a characterization of a class of ""elementary"" CAs that cannot be written as the composition of two simpler parts whose neighborhoods and inverse neighborhoods would be reduced by one half."

The former has clocks that allow to test the lapse of time between two events, whilst the latter includes registers that can store data values for later comparison. Although these two models behave in appearance differently, several decision problems have the same (un)decidability and complexity results for both models. As a prominent example, emptiness is decidable for alternating automata with one clock or register, both with non-primitive recursive complexity. This is not by chance.   This work confirms that there is indeed a tight relationship between the two models. We show that a run of a timed automaton can be simulated by a register automaton, and conversely that a run of a register automaton can be simulated by a timed automaton. Our results allow to transfer complexity and decidability results back and forth between these two kinds of models. We justify the usefulness of these reductions by obtaining new results on register automata."

Intuitively, a calculus is strongly replacement free if replacing, within an enclosing context, a process that cannot perform any visible action by an arbitrary process never inhibits the capability of the resulting process to perform a visible action. We prove that there exists no compositional and interaction sensitive encoding of a not strongly replacement free calculus into any strongly replacement free one. We then define a weaker version of replacement freeness, by only considering replacement of closed processes, and prove that, if we additionally require the encoding to preserve name independence, it is not even possible to encode a non replacement free calculus into a weakly replacement free one. As a consequence of our encodability results, we get that many calculi equipped with priority are not replacement free and hence are not encodable into mainstream calculi like CCS and pi-calculus, that instead are strongly replacement free. We also prove that variants of pi-calculus with match among names, pattern matching or polyadic synchronization are only weakly replacement free, hence they are separated both from process calculi with priority and from mainstream calculi."

First we prove that adding pure interleaving to the theory of regular expressions strictly increases its expressiveness up to bisimilarity. Then, we prove that replacing the operation for pure interleaving by ACP-style parallel composition gives a further increase in expressiveness. Finally, we prove that the theory of regular expressions with ACP-style parallel composition and encapsulation is expressive enough to express all finite automata up to bisimilarity.

In the case of bifix codes contained in Sturmian sets of words, we obtain several new results. Let $F$ be a Sturmian set of words, defined as the set of factors of a strict episturmian word. Our results express the fact that an $F$-maximal bifix code of degree $d$ behaves just as the set of words of $F$ of length $d$. An $F$-maximal bifix code of degree $d$ in a Sturmian set of words on an alphabet with $k$ letters has $(k-1)d+1$ elements. This generalizes the fact that a Sturmian set contains $(k-1)d+1$ words of length $d$. Moreover, given an infinite word $x$, if there is a finite maximal bifix code $X$ of degree $d$ such that $x$ has at most $d$ factors of length $d$ in $X$, then $x$ is ultimately periodic.

2010-11-02 09:36:43+00:00,2011-11-14 20:23:16+00:00,"Asynchronous programming is a ubiquitous systems programming idiom to manage concurrent interactions with the environment. In this style, instead of waiting for time-consuming operations to complete, the programmer makes a non-blocking call to the operation and posts a callback task to a task buffer that is executed later when the time-consuming operation completes. A co-operative scheduler mediates the interaction by picking and executing callback tasks from the task buffer to completion (and these callbacks can post further callbacks to be executed later). Writing correct asynchronous programs is hard because the use of callbacks, while efficient, obscures program control flow.   We provide a formal model underlying asynchronous programs and study verification problems for this model. We show that the safety verification problem for finite-data asynchronous programs is expspace-complete. We show that liveness verification for finite-data asynchronous programs is decidable and polynomial-time equivalent to Petri Net reachability. Decidability is not obvious, since even if the data is finite-state, asynchronous programs constitute infinite-state transition systems: both the program stack and the task buffer of pending asynchronous calls can be potentially unbounded.   Our main technical construction is a polynomial-time semantics-preserving reduction from asynchronous programs to Petri Nets and conversely. The reduction allows the use of algorithmic techniques on Petri Nets to the verification of asynchronous programs.   We also study several extensions to the basic models of asynchronous programs that are inspired by additional capabilities provided by implementations of asynchronous libraries, and classify the decidability and undecidability of verification questions on these extensions."

Moreover, it might happen that while a component is involved in one long lasting high level action, it is involved also in several faster lower level actions. Hence, we propose a process algebra with operations and with a semantics aimed at dealing with these aspects of multiscale modelling.

They have however established some sufficient conditions which ensure convexity. This paper shows that for the CSCG of {P,A}-TPN, this union is convex and can be computed without computing intermediate state classes.

However, the question is still open for many others, e.g., reversal-boundedness.

We will see that this process has a natural connection to ordinal numbers. The paper is presented from the perspective of a non-expert in the field of logic and proof theory.

We characterize epsilon-machines in the language of automata theory and adapt a recent algorithm for generating accessible deterministic finite automata, pruning this over-large class down to that of epsilon-machines. As an application, we exactly enumerate topological epsilon-machines up to eight states and six-letter alphabets."

TCA actions can have multiple start time and deadlines, can be aperiodic, and are selected dynamically following a graph, the time-constrained automaton. This allows expressing much more precise time constraints than classical periodic or sporadic model, while preserving the ease of scheduling and analysis.   We provide some properties of this model as well as their scheduling semantics. We show that TCA can be automatically derived from source-code, and optimally scheduled on single processors using a variant of EDF. We explain how time constraints can be used to guarantee communication determinism by construction, and to study when possible agent interactions happen."
2010-10-27 00:55:18+00:00,2013-12-20 23:00:48+00:00,"We consider two important time scales---the Markov and cryptic orders---that monitor how an observer synchronizes to a finitary stochastic process. We show how to compute these orders exactly and that they are most efficiently calculated from the epsilon-machine, a process's minimal unifilar model. Surprisingly, though the Markov order is a basic concept from stochastic process theory, it is not a probabilistic property of a process. Rather, it is a topological property and, moreover, it is not computable from any finite-state model other than the epsilon-machine. Via an exhaustive survey, we close by demonstrating that infinite Markov and infinite cryptic orders are a dominant feature in the space of finite-memory processes. We draw out the roles played in statistical mechanical spin systems by these two complementary length scales."

Getting a minimal automaton is a fundamental issue in the use and implementation of finite automata tools in frameworks like text processing, image analysis, linguistic computer science, and many other applications. There are two main families of minimization algorithms. The first by a sequence of refinements of a partition of the set of states, the second by a sequence of fusions or merges of states. Hopcroft's and Moore's algorithms belong to the first family, the linear-time minimization of acyclic automata of Revuz belongs to the second family.   One of our studies is upon the comparison of the nature of Moore's and Hopcroft's algorithms. This gives some new insight in both algorithms. As we shall see, these algorithms are quite different both in behavior and in complexity. In particular, we show that it is not possible to simulate the computations of one of the algorithm by the other. We describe the minimization algorithm by fusion for so-called local automata. A special case of minimization is the construction o minimal automata for finite sets. We consider briefly this case, and in particular describe incremental algorithms. Finally, we consider the case of updating a minimal automaton when a word is added or removed from the set it recognizes."
2010-10-24 12:12:10+00:00,2010-10-24 12:12:10+00:00,"In this paper we focus on some aspects related to modeling and formal verification of embedded systems. Many models have been proposed to represent embedded systems. These models encompass a broad range of styles, characteristics, and application domains and include the extensions of finite state machines, data flow graphs, communication processes and Petri nets. In this report, we have used a PRES+ model (Petri net based Representation for Embedded Systems) as an extension of classical Petri net model that captures concurrency, timing behaviour of embedded systems; it allows systems to be representative in different levels of abstraction and improves expressiveness by allowing the token to carry information. Modeling using PRES+, as discussed above, may be convenient for specifying the input behaviour because it supports concurrency. However, there is no equivalence checking method reported in the literature for PRES+ models to the best of our knowledge. In contrast, equivalence checking of FSMD models exist. As a first step, therefore, we seek to devise an algorithm to translate PRES+ models to FSMD models and we seek to hand execute our algorithm on a real life example and we have to translate two versions of PRES+ models to FSMD models. Then using existing equivalence checker we have checked the equivalence between two FSMD models."

The paper answers two questions asked in the literature about the iterated hairpin completion.   The first question is whether the class of regular languages is closed under iterated bounded hairpin completion. Here we show that this is true by providing a more general result which applies to all the classes of languages which are closed under finite union, intersection with regular sets, and concatenation with regular sets. In particular, all Chomsky classes and all standard complexity classes are closed under iterated bounded hairpin completion.   In the second part of the paper we address the question whether the iterated hairpin completion of a singleton is always regular. In contrast to the first question, this one has a negative answer. We exhibit an example of a singleton language whose iterated hairpin completion is not regular, actually it is not context-free, but context-sensitive."

The syntactic complexity of a regular language is the cardinality of its syntactic semigroup. The syntactic complexity of a subclass of regular languages is the worst-case syntactic complexity taken as a function of the state complexity $n$ of languages in that class. We study the syntactic complexity of the class of regular ideal languages and their complements, the closed languages. We prove that $n^{n-1}$ is a tight upper bound on the complexity of right ideals and prefix-closed languages, and that there exist left ideals and suffix-closed languages of syntactic complexity $n^{n-1}+n-1$, and two-sided ideals and factor-closed languages of syntactic complexity $n^{n-2}+(n-2)2^{n-2}+1$."

At the center of these modeling languages we find finite state machines that allow for a fine-grained description how and when specific service requests may interact with other components or the environment. Unfortunately, automata-based approaches suffer from exponential state explosion, a major obstacle to the successful application of these formalisms in modeling real-world scenarios. In order to cope with the complexity of individual specifications we can apply partition refinement, an abstraction technique to alleviate the state explosion problem. But this technique too exhibits exponential time and space complexity and, worse, does not offer any guarantees for success. To better understand as to why partition refinement succeeds in some cases while it fails in others, we conducted an empirical study on the performance of a partition refinement algorithm for Component Interaction Automata specifications. As a result we have identified suitable predictors for the expected effectiveness of partition refinement. It is the structure, not the size, of a specification that weighs heavier on the outcome of partition refinement. In particular, Component Interaction Automata specifications for real-world systems are capable of producing scale-free networks containing structural artifacts that can assist the partition refinement algorithm not only converge earlier, but also yield a significant state space reduction on occasion."

In particular, we show how to efficiently obtain the distribution of such an algorithm's running time cost for any given pattern in a random text model, which can be quite general, from simple uniform models to higher-order Markov models or hidden Markov models (HMMs). Furthermore, we provide a technique to compute the exact distribution of \emph{differences} in running time cost of two algorithms. In contrast to previous work, our approach is neither limited to simple text models, nor to asymptotic statements, nor to moment computations such as expectation and variance. Methodically, we use extensions of finite automata which we call deterministic arithmetic automata (DAAs) and probabilistic arithmetic automata (PAAs) [13]. To our knowledge, this is the first time that substring- or suffix-based pattern matching algorithms are analyzed exactly. Experimentally, we compare Horspool's algorithm, Backward DAWG Matching, and Backward Oracle Matching on prototypical patterns of short length and provide statistics on the size of minimal DAAs for these computations."

Our proof reveals an interesting connection between ternary square-free circular words and closed walks in the $K_{3{,}3}$ graph.

Therein we focused on the study of Hasse diagram generators, i.e., slice graphs that generate only transitive reduced DAGs, and showed that they could be used to solve several problems related to the partial order behavior of p/t-nets. In the present work we show that both slice graphs and Hasse diagram generators are worth studying on their own. First, we prove that any slice graph SG can be effectively transformed into a Hasse diagram generator HG representing the same set of partial orders. Thus from an algorithmic standpoint we introduce a method of transitive reducing infinite families of DAGs specified by slice graphs. Second, we identify the class of saturated slice graphs. By using our transitive reduction algorithm, we prove that the class of partial order languages representable by saturated slice graphs is closed under union, intersection and even under a suitable notion of complementation (cut-width complementation). Furthermore partial order languages belonging to this class can be tested for inclusion and admit canonical representatives in terms of Hasse diagram generators. As an application of our results, we give stronger forms of some results in our previous work, and establish some unknown connections between the partial order behavior of $p/t$-nets and other well known formalisms for the specification of infinite families of partial orders, such as Mazurkiewicz trace languages and message sequence chart (MSC) languages."

The functioning of various computational devices may be expressed in terms of MPMRS (e.g., register machines and many variants of P systems). In particular, this means that MPMRS are computationally complete; however, a direct translation leads to quite a big number of rules. Like for other classes of computationally complete devices, there is a challenge to find a universal system having the smallest number of rules. In this article we present different rule minimization strategies for MPMRS based on encodings and structural transformations. We apply these strategies to the translation of a small universal register machine (Korec, 1996) and we show that there exists a universal MPMRS with 23 rules. Since MPMRS are identical to a restricted variant of P systems with antiport rules, the results we obtained improve previously known results on the number of rules for those systems."

We establish upper and lower bounds for the state complexity of conversions between different types of unranked tree automata."

For the operations of union and intersection the upper and lower bounds of both weakly and strongly deterministic tree automata are obtained. For tree concatenation we establish a tight upper bound that is of a different order than the known state complexity of concatenation of regular string languages. We show that (n+1) ( (m+1)2^n-2^(n-1) )-1 vertical states are sufficient, and necessary in the worst case, to recognize the concatenation of tree languages recognized by (strongly or weakly) deterministic automata with, respectively, m and n vertical states."

Algorithms for converting finite automata to regular expressions have an exponential blow-up in the worst-case. To overcome this, simple heuristic methods have been proposed.   In this paper we analyse some of the heuristics presented in the literature and propose new ones. We also present some experimental comparative results based on uniform random generated deterministic finite automata."
2010-08-10 08:33:37+00:00,2010-08-10 08:33:37+00:00,"The first step when forming the polynomial hierarchies of languages is to consider languages of the form KaL where K and L are over a finite alphabet A and from a given variety V of languages, a being a letter from A. All such KaL's generate the variety of languages BPol1(V).   We estimate the numerical parameters of the language KaL in terms of their values for K and L. These parameters include the state complexity of the minimal complete DFA and the size of the syntactic monoids. We also estimate the cardinality of the image of A* in the Schuetzenberger product of the syntactic monoids of K and L. In these three cases we obtain the optimal bounds.   Finally, we also consider estimates for the cardinalities of free monoids in the variety of monoids corresponding to BPol1(V) in terms of sizes of the free monoids in the variety of monoids corresponding to V."

In this paper, we propose a refinement of this model that generates regular languages using the iterated TGR system with a finite initial language and a finite set of templates, using fewer templates and a smaller alphabet compared to that of the Daley-McQuillan model. To achieve Turing completeness using only finite components, i.e., a finite initial language and a finite set of templates, we also propose an extension of the contextual template-guided recombination system (CTGR system) by Daley and McQuillan, by adding an extra control called permitting contexts on the usage of templates."

A number alpha not satisfying this condition is called a magic number (for n). It was shown in [11] that no magic numbers exist for general regular languages, while in [5] trivial and non-trivial magic numbers for unary regular languages were identified. We obtain similar results for automata accepting subregular languages like, for example, combinational languages, star-free, prefix-, suffix-, and infix-closed languages, and prefix-, suffix-, and infix-free languages, showing that there are only trivial magic numbers, when they exist. For finite languages we obtain some partial results showing that certain numbers are non-magic."

We show that ring-AHNEPs can simulate 2-tag systems, thus we deduce the existence of a universal ring-AHNEP. For star networks or grid networks, we show a more general result; that is, each recursively enumerable language can be accepted efficiently by a star- or grid-AHNEP. We also present bounds for the size of these star and grid networks. As a consequence we get that each recursively enumerable can be accepted by networks with at most 13 communication channels and by networks where each node communicates with at most three other nodes."

2010-07-22 09:38:57+00:00,2010-07-22 09:38:57+00:00,"Currently there is great interest in computational models consisting of underlying regular computational environments, and built on them distributed computational structures. Examples of such models are cellular automata, spatial computation and space-time crystallography. For any computational model it is natural to define a functional equivalence of different but related computational structures. In the finite automata theory an example of such equivalence is automata homomorphism and, in particular, automata isomorphism. If we continue to stick to the finite automata theory, a fundamental question arise, what a state of a distributed computational structure is. This work is devoted to particular solution of the issue."

Such a model usually consists of configurations, instructions, programs, inputs and outputs for the machine. In this paper we formalize these notions as a very simple algebraic system, called a configuration machine. If an abstract machine is defined as a configuration machine consisting of primitive recursive functions then the functions computed by the machine are always recursive. The theory of configuration machines provides a useful tool to study universal machines."

While the former is closer to the actual software or hardware systems with a fixed granularity of time, the abstract character of the latter makes it appealing for system modeling and verification. We study one aspect of the relation between these two semantics, namely checking whether the system exhibits some qualitative (untimed) behaviors in the dense time which cannot be reproduced by any implementation with a fixed sampling rate. More formally, the \emph{sampling problem} is to decide whether there is a sampling rate such that all qualitative behaviors (the untimed language) accepted by a given timed automaton in dense time semantics can be also accepted in sampled semantics. We show that this problem is decidable."
2010-07-16 07:13:39+00:00,2010-07-16 07:13:39+00:00,Supervisory control of discrete-event systems with a global safety specification and with only local supervisors is a difficult problem. For global specifications the equivalent conditions for local control synthesis to equal global control synthesis may not be met. This paper formulates and solves a control synthesis problem for a generator with a global specification and with a combination of a coordinator and local controllers. Conditional controllability is proven to be an equivalent condition for the existence of such a coordinated controller. A procedure to compute the least restrictive solution is also provided in this paper and conditions are stated under which the result of our procedure coincides with the supremal controllable sublanguage.
2010-07-14 15:16:27+00:00,2010-07-14 15:16:27+00:00,In this work a collective of interacting stateless automata in a discrete geometric environment is considered as an integral automata-like computational dynamic object. For such distributed on the environment object different approaches to definition of the measure of state transition are possible. We propose a geometric approach for defining what a state is.
2010-07-13 16:03:11+00:00,2010-08-20 18:10:26+00:00,"In this report we focus on some aspects related to modeling and formal verification of embedded systems. Many models have been proposed to represent embedded systems. These models encompass a broad range of styles, characteristics, and application domains and include the extensions of finite state machines, data flow graphs, communication processes and Petri nets. In this report, we have used a PRES+ model (Petri net based Representation for Embedded Systems) as an extension of classical Petri net model that captures concurrency, timing behaviour of embedded systems; it allows systems to be representative in different levels of abstraction and improves expressiveness by allowing the token to carry information. Modeling using PRES+, as discussed above, may be convenient for specifying the input behaviour because it supports concurrency. However, there is no equivalence checking method reported in the literature for PRES+ models to the best of our knowledge. In contrast, equivalence checking of FSMD models exist. As a first step, therefore, we seek to devise an algorithm to translate PRES+ models to FSMD models."

As the underlying formal model for such programs we use probabilistic pushdown automata (pPDA) which are equivalent to probabilistic recursive state machines. We obtain tail bounds for the distribution of termination time for pPDA. We also study the recurrence time for probabilistic recursive programs that are not supposed to terminate (such as system daemons, network servers, etc.). Typically, such programs react to certain requests generated by their environment, and hence operate in finite request-service cycles. We obtain bounds for the frequency of long request-service cycles."
2010-07-08 10:18:05+00:00,2011-03-14 15:59:24+00:00,"In this report we study the problem of minimising deterministic automata over finite and infinite words. Deterministic finite automata are the simplest devices to recognise regular languages, and deterministic Buchi, Co-Buchi, and parity automata play a similar role in the recognition of \omega-regular languages. While it is well known that the minimisation of deterministic finite and weak automata is cheap, the complexity of minimising deterministic Buchi and parity automata has remained an open challenge. We establish the NP-completeness of these problems. A second contribution of this report is the introduction of relaxed minimisation of deterministic finite automata. Like hyper-minimisation, relaxed minimisation allows for some changes in the language of the automaton: We seek a smallest automaton that, when used as a monitor, provides a wrong answer only a bounded number of times in any run of a system. We argue that minimisation of finite automata, hyper-minimisation, relaxed minimisation, and the minimisation of deterministic Buchi (or Co-Buchi) automata are operations of increasing reduction power, as the respective equivalence relations on automata become coarser from left to right. When we allow for minor changes in the language, relaxed minimisation can therefore be considered as a more powerful minimisation technique than hyper-minimisation from the perspective of finite automata. From the perspective of Buchi and Co-Buchi automata, we gain a cheap algorithm for state-space reduction that also turns out to be beneficial for further heuristic or exhaustive state-space reductions put on top of it."
2010-07-07 05:21:00+00:00,2010-07-07 05:21:00+00:00,"We give a sequential model for noninterference security including probability (but not demonic choice), thus supporting reasoning about the likelihood that high-security values might be revealed by observations of low-security activity. Our novel methodological contribution is the definition of a refinement order and its use to compare security measures between specifications and (their supposed) implementations. This contrasts with the more common practice of evaluating the security of individual programs in isolation.   The appropriateness of our model and order is supported by our showing that our refinement order is the greatest compositional relation --the compositional closure-- with respect to our semantics and an ""elementary"" order based on Bayes Risk --- a security measure already in widespread use. We also relate refinement to other measures such as Shannon Entropy.   By applying the approach to a non-trivial example, the anonymous-majority Three-Judges protocol, we demonstrate by example that correctness arguments can be simplified by the sort of layered developments --through levels of increasing detail-- that are allowed and encouraged by compositional semantics."
2010-07-07 04:27:59+00:00,2010-07-26 17:02:32+00:00,"Let $\mathcal{P}(\Sigma^*)$ be the semiring of languages, and consider its subset $\mathcal{P}(\Sigma)$. In this paper we define the language recognized by a weighted automaton over $\mathcal{P}(\Sigma)$ and a one-letter alphabet. Similarly, we introduce the notion of language recognition by linear recurrence equations with coefficients in $\mathcal{P}(\Sigma)$. As we will see, these two definitions coincide. We prove that the languages recognized by linear recurrence equations with coefficients in $\mathcal{P}(\Sigma)$ are precisely the regular languages, thus providing an alternative way to present these languages. A remarkable consequence of this kind of recognition is that it induces a partition of the language into its cross-sections, where the $n$th cross-section contains all the words of length $n$ in the language. Finally, we show how to use linear recurrence equations to calculate the density function of a regular language, which assigns to every $n$ the number of words of length $n$ in the language. We also show how to count the number of successful paths of a weighted automaton."

Such reachability problems play a paramount role in dependability analysis and the modelling of manufacturing and queueing systems. Consequently, their analysis has been studied intensively, and techniques for the approximation of optimal control are well understood. From a mathematical point of view, however, the question of approximation is secondary compared to the fundamental question whether or not optimal control exists.   We demonstrate the existence of optimal schedulers for the time-abstract scheduler classes for all CTMDPs. Our proof is constructive: We show how to compute optimal time-abstract strategies with finite memory. It turns out that these optimal schedulers have an amazingly simple structure - they converge to an easy-to-compute memoryless scheduling policy after a finite number of steps.   Finally, we show that our argument can easily be lifted to Markov games: We show that both players have a likewise simple optimal strategy in these more general structures."

While keeping the same expressiveness, CWC strongly simplifies the development of automatic tools for the analysis of biological systems. The main simplification consists in the removal of the sequencing operator, thus lightening the formal treatment of the patterns to be matched in a term (whose complexity in CLS is strongly affected by the variables matching in the sequences).   We define a stochastic semantics for this new calculus. As an application we model the interaction between macrophages and apoptotic neutrophils and a mechanism of gene regulation in E.Coli."

We study the quotient complexity, more commonly known as state complexity, of operations in the classes of bifix-, factor-, and subword-free regular languages.

2010-06-18 08:48:58+00:00,2010-06-18 08:48:58+00:00,"Arguably, omega-regular languages play an important role as a specification formalism in many approaches to systems monitoring via runtime verification. However, since their elements are infinite words, not every omega-regular language can sensibly be monitored at runtime when only a finite prefix of a word, modelling the observed system behaviour so far, is available. The monitorability of an omega-regular language, L, is thus a property that holds, if for any finite word u, observed so far, it is possible to add another finite word v, such that uv becomes a ""finite witness"" wrt. L; that is, for any infinite word w, we have that uvw \in L, or for any infinite word w, we have that uvw \not\in L. This notion has been studied in the past by several authors, and it is known that the class of monitorable languages is strictly more expressive than, e.g., the commonly used class of so-called safety languages. But an exact categorisation of monitorable languages has, so far, been missing. Motivated by the use of linear-time temporal logic (LTL) in many approaches to runtime verification, this paper first determines the complexity of the monitorability problem when L is given by an LTL formula. Further, it then shows that this result, in fact, transfers to omega-regular languages in general, i.e., whether they are given by an LTL formula, a nondeterministic Buechi automaton, or even by an omega-regular expression."

Strong Convergence requires in addition that redex positions in a reduction sequence move arbitrarily deep.

We present a set of reasonable constraints on tape geometry and classify all tapes conforming to these constraints. Surprisingly, this generalization does not lead to yet another equivalent formulation of the notion of computable function. Rather, it gives an alternative definition of the recursively enumerable Turing degrees that does not rely on oracles. The definitions give rise to a number of questions about computable paths inside Cayley graphs of finitely generated groups, and several of these questions are answered."

The language $\L(M)$ is well-ordered by the lexicographic order $\slex$ iff whenever the non sink states $q,q.0$ are in the same strong component, then $q.1$ is a sink. It is easy to see that this property is sufficient. In order to show the necessity, we analyze the behavior of a $\slex$-descending sequence of words. This property is used to obtain a polynomial time algorithm to determine, given a DFA $M$, whether $\L(M)$ is well-ordered by the lexicographic order. Last, we apply an argument in \cite{BE,BEa} to give a proof that the least nonregular ordinal is $\omega^\omega $."

For all four fragments, we give characterizations in terms of rankers. In particular, we generalize the notion of a ranker to infinite words in two possible ways. Both extensions are natural in the sense that over finite words, they coincide with classical rankers and over infinite words, they both have the full expressive power of FO2. Moreover, the first extension of rankers admits a characterization of the intersection of Sigma2 and FO2 while the other leads to a characterization of the intersection of Pi2 and FO2. Both versions of rankers yield characterizations of the fragment Delta2. As a byproduct, we also obtain characterizations based on unambiguous temporal logic and unambiguous interval temporal logic."

That is, we demonstrate the existence of finite optimal control. Finally, we show that these pleasant properties of Markov decision processes extend to the more general class of continuous-time Markov games, and that both early and late schedulers show this behaviour."

In these grammars, two nonterminal symbols are attached to each context-free production, and such a production is applicable if one of the two attached symbols occurs in the current sentential form, while the other does not. Specifically, this paper demonstrates that the family of languages generated by semi-conditional grammars of degree (1,1) coincides with the family of random context languages. In addition, it shows that the normal form proved by Mayer for random context grammars with erasing productions holds for random context grammars without erasing productions, too. It also discusses two possible definitions of the relation of the direct derivation step used in the literature."

In good cases, they give finite presentations of the monoids, allowing their manipulation by a computer. Even better, when the presentation is confluent and terminating, they provide one with a notion of canonical representative for the elements of the presented monoid. Polygraphs are a higher-dimensional generalization of this notion of presentation, from the setting of monoids to the much more general setting of n-categories. Here, we are interested in proving confluence for polygraphs presenting 2-categories, which can be seen as a generalization of term rewriting systems. For this purpose, we propose an adaptation of the usual algorithm for computing critical pairs. Interestingly, this framework is much richer than term rewriting systems and requires the elaboration of a new theoretical framework for representing critical pairs, based on contexts in compact 2-categories."

Fault diagnosis consists in synthesizing a diagnoser that observes a given plant and identifies faults in the plant as soon as possible after their occurrence. Existing literature on this problem has considered the case of fixed static observers, where the set of observable events is fixed and does not change during execution of the system. In this paper, we consider dynamic observers: an observer can ""switch"" sensors on or off, thus dynamically changing the set of events it wishes to observe. It is known that checking diagnosability (i.e., whether a given observer is capable of identifying faults) can be solved in polynomial time for static observers, and we show that the same is true for dynamic ones. We also solve the problem of dynamic observers' synthesis and prove that a most permissive observer can be computed in doubly exponential time, using a game-theoretic approach. We further investigate optimization problems for dynamic observers and define a notion of cost of an observer."

We provide a uniform characterization of codiagnosability for FA and TA which extends the necessary and sufficient condition that characterizes diagnosability. We also settle the complexity of the codiagnosability problems both for FA and TA and show that codiagnosability is PSPACE-complete in both cases. For FA this improves on the previously known bound (EXPTIME) and for TA it is a new result. Finally we address the codiagnosis problem for TA under bounded resources and show it is 2EXPTIME-complete.

Unfortunately, there is no algorithm capable of learning the complete class of deterministic regular expressions from positive examples only, as we will show. The regular expressions occurring in practical DTDs and XSDs, however, are such that every alphabet symbol occurs only a small number of times. As such, in practice it suffices to learn the subclass of deterministic regular expressions in which each alphabet symbol occurs at most k times, for some small k. We refer to such expressions as k-occurrence regular expressions (k-OREs for short). Motivated by this observation, we provide a probabilistic algorithm that learns k-OREs for increasing values of k, and selects the deterministic one that best describes the sample based on a Minimum Description Length argument. The effectiveness of the method is empirically validated both on real world and synthetic data. Furthermore, the method is shown to be conservative over the simpler classes of expressions considered in previous work."

Under a probabilistic assumption about the possible inputs, such a preference order is naturally expressed by a weighted automaton, which assigns to each word a value, such that a system is preferred if it generates a higher expected value. We solve the following optimal-synthesis problem: given an omega-regular specification, a Markov chain that describes the distribution of inputs, and a weighted automaton that measures how well a system satisfies the given specification under the given input assumption, synthesize a system that optimizes the measured value.   For safety specifications and measures given by mean-payoff automata, the optimal-synthesis problem amounts to finding a strategy in a Markov decision process (MDP) that is optimal for a long-run average reward objective, which can be done in polynomial time. For general omega-regular specifications, the solution rests on a new, polynomial-time algorithm for computing optimal strategies in MDPs with mean-payoff parity objectives.   Our algorithm generates optimal strategies consisting of two memoryless strategies and a counter. This counter is in general not bounded. To obtain a finite-state system, we show how to construct an \epsilon-optimal strategy with a bounded counter for any \epsilon>0. We also show how to decide in polynomial time if we can construct an optimal finite-state system (i.e., a system without a counter) for a given specification.   We have implemented our approach in a tool that takes qualitative and quantitative specifications and automatically constructs a system that satisfies the qualitative specification and optimizes the quantitative specification, if such a system exists. We present experimental results showing optimal systems that were generated in this way."

In previous work, it has been established that the sets of numbers that are recognizable by weak deterministic automata in two bases that do not share the same set of prime factors are exactly those that are definable in the first order additive theory of real and integer numbers. This result extends Cobham's theorem, which characterizes the sets of integer numbers that are recognizable by finite automata in multiple bases.   In this article, we first generalize this result to multiplicatively independent bases, which brings it closer to the original statement of Cobham's theorem. Then, we study the sets of reals recognizable by Muller automata in two bases. We show with a counterexample that, in this setting, Cobham's theorem does not generalize to multiplicatively independent bases. Finally, we prove that the sets of reals that are recognizable by Muller automata in two bases that do not share the same set of prime factors are exactly those definable in the first order additive theory of real and integer numbers.

This result leads to a precise characterization of the sets of real numbers that are recognizable in multiple bases, and provides a theoretical justification to the use of weak automata as symbolic representations of sets."

In the present work, it is shown that the same result also holds for Shannon's original definition of probabilistic capacity.

We aim to overcome two facts: 1) simulation is not identification, 2) the ASMs simulating machines of some type do not constitute a natural class among all ASMs. We modify Gurevich's notion of ASM to that of EMA (""Evolving MultiAlgebra"") by replacing the program (which is a syntactic object) by a semantic object: a functional which has to be very simply definable over the static part of the ASM. We prove that very natural classes of EMAs correspond via ""literal identifications"" to slight extensions of the usual machine models and also to grammar models. Though we modify these models, we keep their computation approach: only some contingencies are modified. Thus, EMAs appear as the mathematical model unifying all kinds of sequential computation paradigms."

2009-11-17 12:07:16+00:00,2009-11-17 12:07:16+00:00,"The vertices of a finite state system are usually a subset of the natural numbers. Most algorithms relative to these systems only use this fact to select vertices.   For infinite state systems, however, the situation is different: in particular, for such systems having a finite description, each state of the system is a configuration of some machine. Then most algorithmic approaches rely on the structure of these configurations. Such characterisations are said internal. In order to apply algorithms detecting a structural property (like identifying connected components) one may have first to transform the system in order to fit the description needed for the algorithm. The problem of internal characterisation is that it hides structural properties, and each solution becomes ad hoc relatively to the form of the configurations.   On the contrary, external characterisations avoid explicit naming of the vertices. Such characterisation are mostly defined via graph transformations.   In this paper we present two kind of external characterisations: deterministic graph rewriting, which in turn characterise regular graphs, deterministic context-free languages, and rational graphs. Inverse substitution from a generator (like the complete binary tree) provides characterisation for prefix-recognizable graphs, the Caucal Hierarchy and rational graphs. We illustrate how these characterisation provide an efficient tool for the representation of infinite state systems."

Some unanswered questions are related to the computational power of such systems, and finding a characterization of the class of circular languages generated by circular splicing systems is still an open problem. In this paper we solve this problem for complete systems, which are special finite circular splicing systems. We show that a circular language L is generated by a complete system if and only if the set Lin(L) of all words corresponding to L is a pure unitary language generated by a set closed under the conjugacy relation. The class of pure unitary languages was introduced by A. Ehrenfeucht, D. Haussler, G. Rozenberg in 1983, as a subclass of the class of context-free languages, together with a characterization of regular pure unitary languages by means of a decidable property. As a direct consequence, we characterize (regular) circular languages generated by complete systems. We can also decide whether the language generated by a complete system is regular. Finally, we point out that complete systems have the same computational power as finite simple systems, an easy type of circular splicing system defined in the literature from the very beginning, when only one rule is allowed. From our results on complete systems, it follows that finite simple systems generate a class of context-free languages containing non-regular languages, showing the incorrectness of a longstanding result on simple systems."

We consider two simple problems related to the maximum number of subwords which are squares or which are highly repetitive; then we provide a nontrivial estimation for the number of cubes. We show that the maximum number of squares $xx$ such that $x$ is not a primitive word (nonprimitive squares) in a word of length $n$ is exactly $\lfloor \frac{n}{2}\rfloor - 1$, and the maximum number of subwords of the form $x^k$, for $k\ge 3$, is exactly $n-2$.

We show that every continuous \omega-function definable by some WFA can be defined by an average preserving WFA and then characterize minimal average preserving WFA whose \omega-function or \omega-function and real function are continuous.   We obtain several algorithmic reductions for WFA-related decision problems. In particular, we show that deciding whether the \omega-function and real function of an average preserving WFA are both continuous is computationally equivalent to deciding stability of a set of matrices.   We also present a method for constructing WFA that compute continuous real functions."

A language L over an alphabet Sigma is a right (left) ideal if it satisfies L = L Sigma* (L = Sigma* L). It is a two-sided ideal if L = Sigma* L Sigma *, and an all-sided ideal if it is the shuffle of Sigma* with L. We prefer the term ""quotient complexity"" instead of ""state complexity"", and we use derivatives to calculate upper bounds on quotient complexity, whenever it is convenient. We find tight upper bounds on the quotient complexity of each type of ideal language in terms of the complexity of an arbitrary generator and of its minimal generator, the complexity of the minimal generator, and also on the operations union, intersection, set difference, symmetric difference, concatenation, star and reversal of ideal languages."

The Spiral Rule automaton is a hexagonal ternary-state two-dimensional cellular automaton -- a finite-state machine imitation of an activator-inhibitor reaction-diffusion system. The activator is self-inhibited in certain concentrations. The inhibitor dissociates in the absence of the activator. The Spiral Rule cellular automaton has rich spatio-temporal dynamics of traveling (glider) and stationary (eater) patterns. When a glider brushes an eater the eater may slightly change its configuration, which is updated once more every next hit. We encode binary strings in the states of eaters and sequences of gliders. We study what types of binary compositions of binary strings are implementable by sequences of gliders brushing an eater. The models developed will be used in future laboratory designs of reaction-diffusion chemical computers."

However, in that construction, the maximal number of nonterminals simultaneously rewritten during a derivation step depends on many factors, such as the cardinality of the alphabet of the generated language and the structure of the generated language itself. This paper improves the result by showing that the maximal number of nonterminals simultaneously rewritten during any derivation step can be limited by a small constant regardless of other factors."

We show that there are universal ANEPFCs of size 10, by devising a method for simulating 2-Tag Systems. This result significantly improves the known upper bound for the size of universal ANEPFCs which is 18.   We also propose a new, computationally and descriptionally efficient simulation of nondeterministic Turing machines by ANEPFCs. More precisely, we describe (informally, due to space limitations) how ANEPFCs with 16 nodes can simulate in O(f(n)) time any nondeterministic Turing machine of time complexity f(n). Thus the known upper bound for the number of nodes in a network simulating an arbitrary Turing machine is decreased from 26 to 16."

We investigate one of the weakest classes, the real-time one-way cellular automata, and impose an additional restriction on their inter-cell communication by bounding the number of allowed uses of the links between cells. Moreover, we consider the devices as acceptors for bounded languages in order to explore the borderline at which non-trivial decidability problems of cellular automata classes become decidable. It is shown that even devices with drastically reduced communication, that is, each two neighboring cells may communicate only constantly often, accept bounded languages that are not semilinear. If the number of communications is at least logarithmic in the length of the input, several problems are undecidable. The same result is obtained for classes where the total number of communications during a computation is linearly bounded."

Similarly as in the case of the classical two-way machines, it is not known whether there exists a polynomial trade-off, in the number of states, between the nondeterministic and deterministic pebble two-way automata. However, we show that these two machine models are not independent: if there exists a polynomial trade-off for the classical two-way automata, then there must also exist a polynomial trade-off for the pebble two-way automata. Thus, we have an upward collapse (or a downward separation) from the classical two-way automata to more powerful pebble automata, still staying within the class of regular languages. The same upward collapse holds for complementation of nondeterministic two-way machines.   These results are obtained by showing that each pebble machine can be, by using suitable inputs, simulated by a classical two-way automaton with a linear number of states (and vice versa), despite the existing exponential blow-up between the classical and pebble two-way machines."

Here we continue this line of research introducing J languages and proving that they can be accepted by place/transition systems whose underlying net is composed only of joins. Moreover, we investigate how J languages relate to other families of formal languages. In particular, we show that every J language can be accepted by a log n space-bounded non-deterministic Turing machine with a one-way read-only input. We also show that every J language has a semilinear Parikh map and that J languages and context-free languages (CFLs) are incomparable."

In the context of formal languages, both FSA and regular expressions (RE) are equivalent in that they accept and generate, respectively, type-3 (regular) languages. Based on our previous work, this paper analyzes effects of graph manipulations on corresponding RE. In this present, starting stage we assume that the DG under consideration contains no cycles. Graph manipulation is performed by deleting or inserting of nodes or arcs. Combined and/or multiple application of these basic operators enable a great variety of transformations of DG (and corresponding RE) that can be seen as mutants of the original DG (and corresponding RE). DG are popular for modeling complex systems; however they easily become intractable if the system under consideration is complex and/or large. In such situations, we propose to switch to corresponding RE in order to benefit from their compact format for modeling and algebraic operations for analysis. The results of the study are of great potential interest to mutation testing."

The underlying notion of an accepting run can be defined as for standard omega-automata by means of a Buechi condition or other acceptance conditions, e.g., Rabin or Streett conditions.

Since state complexity is a property of a language, it is appropriate to define it in formal-language terms as the number of distinct quotients of the language, and to call it ""quotient complexity"". The problem of finding the quotient complexity of a language f(K,L) is considered, where K and L are regular languages and f is a regular operation, for example, union or concatenation. Since quotients can be represented by derivatives, one can find a formula for the typical quotient of f(K,L) in terms of the quotients of K and L. To obtain an upper bound on the number of quotients of f(K,L) all one has to do is count how many such quotients are possible, and this makes automaton constructions unnecessary. The advantages of this point of view are illustrated by many examples. Moreover, new general observations are presented to help in the estimation of the upper bounds on quotient complexity of regular operations."

Such families preserve to a varying degree the basic algebraic properties of Regular languages: boolean closure, closure under reversal, under concatenation, and Kleene star. We prove that the VPDA family is strictly contained within the Floyd Grammars (FG) family historically known as operator precedence. Languages over the same precedence matrix are known to be closed under boolean operations, and are recognized by a machine whose pop or push operations on the stack are purely determined by terminal letters. We characterize VPDA's as the subclass of FG having a peculiarly structured set of precedence relations, and balanced grammars as a further restricted case. The non-counting invariance property of FG has a direct implication for VPDA too."

We show that these graph grammars can be embedded in a graph rewriting characterization of distributed systems that was proposed by Degano and Montanari over twenty years ago. We apply this embedding to generalize Soloveichik and Winfree's local determinism criterion (for achieving a unique terminal assembly), from assembly systems of 4-sided tiles that embed in the plane, to arbitrary graph assembly systems. We present a partial converse of the embedding result, by providing sufficient conditions under which systems of distributed processors can be simulated by graph assembly systems topologically, in the plane, and in 3-space. We conclude by defining a new complexity measure: ""surface cost"" (essentially the convex hull of the space inhabited by agents at the conclusion of a self-assembled computation). We show that, for growth-bounded graphs, executing a subroutine to find a Maximum Independent Set only increases the surface cost of a self-assembling computation by a constant factor. We obtain this complexity bound by using the simulation results to import the distributed computing notions of ""local synchronizer"" and ""deterministic coin flipping"" into self-assembly."

We prove precise structure theorems that characterize the exact expressive power of first-order logic with two variables on words. Our results apply to both the case with and without a successor relation. For both languages, our structure theorems show exactly what is expressible using a given quantifier depth, n, and using m blocks of alternating quantifiers, for any m \leq n. Using these characterizations, we prove, among other results, that there is a strict hierarchy of alternating quantifiers for both languages. The question whether there was such a hierarchy had been completely open. As another consequence of our structural results, we show that satisfiability for first-order logic with two variables without successor, which is NEXP-complete in general, becomes NP-complete once we only consider alphabets of a bounded size."

An exact generation algorithm can be used to partition the set of ICDFAs in order to parallelize the counting of minimal automata (and thus of regular languages). We present also a uniform random generator for ICDFAs that uses a table of pre-calculated values. Based on the same table it is also possible to obtain an optimal coding for ICDFAs."

Its central feature is that one considers the behavior of an evolving system as the result of a computation. To this end an observer records this behavior. It has turned out that the observed behavior of computationally simple systems can be very complex, when an appropriate observer is used. For example, a restricted version of context-free grammars with regular observers suffices to obtain computational completeness. As a second instantiation presented here, we apply an observer to sticker systems. Finally, some directions for further research are proposed."

The values are updated in the following way: 0s are changed to 1s at all positions where the value to the right is a 1, while 1s are changed to 0s at all positions where the values to the left and right are both 1. Though trivial to define, the behavior exhibited by Rule 110 is surprisingly intricate, and in (Cook, 2004) we showed that it is capable of emulating the activity of a Turing machine by encoding the Turing machine and its tape into a repeating left pattern, a central pattern, and a repeating right pattern, which Rule 110 then acts on. In this paper we provide an explicit compiler for converting a Turing machine into a Rule 110 initial state, and we present a general approach for proving that such constructions will work as intended. The simulation was originally assumed to require exponential time, but surprising results of Neary and Woods (2006) have shown that in fact, only polynomial time is required.

Guidelines are used in specific domains (e.g., avionics) to recommend the proper use of technologies. Consistency rules are used to deal with inconsistencies in models. However, guidelines and consistency rules use informal restrictions on the uses of languages, which makes checking difficult. In this paper, we consider these problems from a language-theoretic view. We propose the formalism of C-Systems, short for ""formal language control systems"". A C-System consists of a controlled grammar and a controlling grammar. Guidelines and consistency rules are formalized as controlling grammars that control the uses of UML, i.e. the derivations using the grammar of UML. This approach can be implemented as a parser, which can automatically verify the rules on a UML user model in XMI format. A comparison to related work shows our contribution: a generic top-down and syntax-based approach that checks language level constraints at compile-time."

This paper proposes such a formalism, namely interface control systems (or shortly C-Systems). An interface C-System is composed of an interface automaton and a controlling automaton, which formalizes safe interactions and restricts system behavior at the meta level. This framework differs from the framework of traditional model checking. It explicitly separates the tasks of product engineers and safety engineers, and provides a top-down technique for modeling a system with safety constraints, and for automatically composing a safe system that conforms to safety requirements.

On the other hand, it is known that if the time is measured considering, for each accepted string, only the faster accepting computation (weak measure), then there exist nonregular languages accepted in linear time. We prove that under this measure, each accepting computation should exhibit a crossing sequence of length at least \log\log n.

It is known that they accept exactly the class of ultralinear context-free languages. Furthermore, the increase in size when converting arbitrary PDAs accepting ultralinear languages to finite-turn PDAs cannot be bounded by any recursive function. The latter phenomenon is known as non-recursive trade-off. In this paper, finite-turn PDAs accepting bounded languages are considered. First, letter-bounded languages are studied. We prove that in this case the non-recursive trade-off is reduced to a recursive trade-off, more precisely, to an exponential trade-off. A conversion algorithm is presented and the optimality of the construction is shown by proving tight lower bounds. Furthermore, the question of reducing the number of turns of a given finite-turn PDA is studied. Again, a conversion algorithm is provided which shows that in this case the trade-off is at most polynomial. Finally, the more general case of word-bounded languages is investigated. We show how the results obtained for letter-bounded languages can be extended to word-bounded languages."

OC-MDPs are equivalent to a controlled extension of (discrete-time) Quasi-Birth-Death processes (QBDs), a stochastic model studied heavily in queueing theory and applied probability. They can thus be viewed as a natural ``adversarial'' version of a classic stochastic model. Alternatively, they can also be viewed as a natural probabilistic/controlled extension of classic one-counter automata. OC-MDPs also subsume (as a very restricted special case) a recently studied MDP model called ``solvency games'' that model a risk-averse gambling scenario. Basic computational questions about these models include ``termination'' questions and ``limit'' questions, such as the following: does the controller have a ``strategy'' (or ``policy'') to ensure that the counter (which may for example count the number of jobs in the queue) will hit value 0 (the empty queue) almost surely (a.s.)? Or that it will have infinite limsup value, a.s.? Or, that it will hit value 0 in selected terminal states, a.s.? Or, in case these are not satisfied a.s., compute the maximum (supremum) such probability over all strategies. We provide new upper and lower bounds on the complexity of such problems. For some of them we present a polynomial-time algorithm, whereas for others we show PSPACE- or BH-hardness and give an EXPTIME upper bound.

These notions become precise by introducing fuzzy labeled transition systems. Solutions of fuzzy molecules and fuzzy reaction rules are used to define the general notion of a fuzzy chemical abstract machine, which is a {\em realization} of the fuzzy chemical metaphor.

This approach holds promise for solving combinatorial problems in scheduling, rostering, and configuration, as well as problems in more diverse areas like bioinformatics, software testing and natural language processing. In addition, decomposition may be an effective method to propagate other global constraints."
2009-02-16 20:41:25+00:00,2015-08-24 15:05:58+00:00,"Pseudorandomness has played a central role in modern cryptography, finding theoretical and practical applications to various fields of computer science. A function that generates pseudorandom strings from shorter but truly random seeds is known as a pseudorandom generator. Our generators are designed to fool languages (or equivalently, Boolean-valued functions). In particular, our generator fools advised context-free languages, namely, context-free languages assisted by external information known as advice, and moreover our generator is made almost one-to-one, stretching $n$-bit seeds to $n+1$ bits. We explicitly construct such a pseudorandom generator, which is computed by a deterministic Turing machine using logarithmic space and also belongs to CFLMV(2)/n---a functional extension of the 2-conjunctive closure of CFL with the help of appropriate deterministic advice. In contrast, we show that there is no almost one-to-one pseudorandom generator against context-free languages if we demand that it should be computed by a nondeterministic pushdown automaton equipped with a write-only output tape. Our generator naturally extends known pseudorandom generators against advised regular languages. Our proof of the CFL/n-pseudorandomness of the generator is quite elementary, and in particular, one part of the proof utilizes a special feature of the behaviors of nondeterministic pushdown automata, called a swapping property, which is interesting in its own right, generalizing the swapping lemma for context-free languages."

While optimal complementation techniques for finite automata are simple - it suffices to determinize them using a simple subset construction and to dualize the acceptance condition of the resulting automaton - B\""uchi complementation is more involved. Indeed, the construction of an EXPTIME complementation procedure took a quarter of a century from the introduction of B\""uchi automata in the early 60s, and stepwise narrowing the gap between the upper and lower bound to a simple exponent (of (6e)n for B\""uchi automata with n states) took four decades. While the distance between the known upper (O'(0.96 n)n') and lower ('(0.76 n)n') bound on the required number of states has meanwhile been significantly reduced, an exponential factor remains between them. Also, the upper bound on the size of the complement automaton is not linear in the bound of its state space. These gaps are unsatisfactory from a theoretical point of view, but also because B\""uchi complementation is a useful tool in formal verification, in particular for the language containment problem. This paper proposes a B\""uchi complementation algorithm whose complexity meets, modulo a quadratic (O(n2)) factor, the known lower bound for B\""uchi complementation. It thus improves over previous constructions by an exponential factor and concludes the quest for optimal B\""uchi complementation algorithms."

Those are finite states games in which, at each round, the two players choose, simultaneously and independently, an action. Then a successor state is chosen accordingly to some fixed probability distribution depending on the previous state and on the pair of actions chosen by the players. Imperfect information is modeled as follows: both players have an equivalence relation over states and, instead of observing the exact state, they only know to which equivalence class it belongs. Therefore, if two partial plays are indistinguishable by some player, he should behave the same in both of them. We consider reachability (does the play eventually visit a final state?) and B\""uchi objective (does the play visit infinitely often a final state?). Our main contribution is to prove that the following problem is complete for 2-ExpTime: decide whether the first player has a strategy that ensures her to almost-surely win against any possible strategy of her oponent. We also characterise those strategies needed by the first player to almost-surely win."

We prove that (i) there is a context-free REG-immune language outside REG/n and (ii) there is a REG-bi-immune language that can be computed deterministically using logarithmic space. We also show that (iii) there is a CFL-simple set, where a CFL-simple language is an infinite context-free language whose complement is CFL-immune. Similar to the REG-immunity, a REG-primeimmune language has no polynomially dense subsets that are also regular. We further prove that (iv) there is a context-free language that is REG/n-bi-primeimmune. Concerning pseudorandomness of context-free languages, we show that (v) CFL contains REG/n-pseudorandom languages.

We generalize the theorem to self-touching configurations, where bars can touch but not properly cross. At the heart of our proof is a new definition of self-touching configurations of planar linkages, based on an annotated configuration space and limits of nontouching configurations. We show that this definition is equivalent to the previously proposed definition of self-touching configurations, which is based on a combinatorial description of overlapping features. Using our new definition, we prove the generalized Carpenter's Rule Theorem using a topological argument. We believe that our topological methodology provides a powerful tool for manipulating many kinds of self-touching objects, such as 3D hinged assemblies of polygons and rigid origami. In particular, we show how to apply our methodology to extend to self-touching configurations universal reconfigurability results for open chains with slender polygonal adornments, and single-vertex rigid origami with convex cones."

Hromkovi\v{c}, Acta Informatica 19 (1983) 377-384), and it has been shown that this new one-way QFAs (multi-letter QFAs) can accept with no error some regular languages $(a+b)^{*}b$ that are unacceptable by the previous one-way QFAs. In this paper, we study the decidability of the equivalence of multi-letter QFAs, and the main technical contributions are as follows: (1) We show that any two automata, a $k_{1}$-letter QFA ${\cal A}_1$ and a $k_{2}$-letter QFA ${\cal A}_2$, over the same input alphabet $\Sigma$ are equivalent if and only if they are $(n^2m^{k-1}-m^{k-1}+k)$-equivalent, where $m=|\Sigma|$ is the cardinality of $\Sigma$, $k=\max(k_{1},k_{2})$, and $n=n_{1}+n_{2}$, with $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ being the numbers of states of ${\cal A}_{1}$ and ${\cal A}_{2}$, respectively. When $k=1$, we obtain the decidability of equivalence of measure-once QFAs in the literature. It is worth mentioning that our technical method is essentially different from that for the decidability of the case of single input alphabet (i.e., $m=1$). (2) However, if we determine the equivalence of multi-letter QFAs by checking all strings of length not more than $ n^2m^{k-1}-m^{k-1}+k$, then the worst time complexity is exponential, i.e., $O(n^6m^{n^2m^{k-1}-m^{k-1}+2k-1})$. Therefore, we design a polynomial-time $O(m^{2k-1}n^{8}+km^kn^{6})$ algorithm for determining the equivalence of any two multi-letter QFAs. Here, the time complexity is concerning the number of states in the multi-letter QFAs, and $k$ is thought of as a constant."

However, there are natural properties for which the pumping lemmas are of little use. One of such examples concerns a notion of advice, which depends only on the size of an underlying input. A standard pumping lemma encounters difficulty in proving that a given language is not regular in the presence of advice. We develop its substitution, called a swapping lemma for regular languages, to demonstrate the non-regularity of a target language with advice. For context-free languages, we also present a similar form of swapping lemma, which serves as a technical tool to show that certain languages are not context-free with advice."

Then $\limsup_{k\to\infty} (j_k/i_k)$ is algebraic if $\mb w$ is morphic, and rational if $\mb w$ is automatic. As a result, we show that the same conclusion holds if $(i_k,j_k)$ are the starting and ending positions of the $k$'th maximal zero block, and, more generally, of the $k$'th maximal $x$-block, where $x$ is an arbitrary word. This enables us to draw conclusions about the irrationality exponent of automatic and morphic numbers.
